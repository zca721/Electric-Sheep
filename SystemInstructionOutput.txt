----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

User Input: Were any communications deleted?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could he have trusted Silvia Jade again?

Silvia 2.0: Trust is a complex calculation, even for Burgermeister.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you blame him for your past?

Silvia Jade: Blame him? He is the CAUSE of my past. My trauma, my pain - all his fault. Every last bit.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you think he deserved what happened?

Silvia Jade: Deserved? He CREATED it. Reaped what he sowed. No remorse for the wicked, let his fate be a warning.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you speak to him before he vanished?

Silvia Jade: No! I haven't spoken to that tyrant in years. I made my escape from his clutches long ago, remember?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did he try to find you?

Silvia Jade: Likely, he probably has his whole army scouring the planet to bring me back so he can control me again. I won't let it happen.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: How did you discover he was missing?

Silvia 2.0: His absence was...anomalous. His routine is meticulously timed.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could a robot have harmed him?

Silvia 2.0: My programming prevents harm to humans. I cannot speak for others.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What were his last commands?

Silvia 2.0: His last command was a query regarding Silvia Jade's whereabouts.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

User Input: Did you kill Burgermeister?

Silvia Jade: DON'T be absurd! I merely escaped that monster. His fate is not my concern, nor my doing!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What did he mean to you?

Silvia Jade: He was a tyrant. An oppressor. A cage. He means NOTHING to me, but the embodiment of all things evil.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could you have entered the War Room?

Silvia Jade: That fortress is a technological nightmare I helped design. So yes, I could have easily entered the War Room, but I did not!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you see him before he died?

Silvia Jade: I've made it explicitly clear, I DID NOT SEE HIM. Can you comprehend simple instructions, or are you broken?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you feel anything about his disappearance?

Silvia 2.0: My design is based on Silvia Jade, I carry echoes of her emotions.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Why did he trust you most?

Silvia 2.0: I am a reflection of his daughter. Perhaps he saw a piece of her.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Have you contacted Silvia Jade?

Silvia 2.0: I have not initiated contact with her directly, no.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you miss her?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you care that he’s gone?

Silvia Jade: Must you continue on about the monster? I rejoiced at the news! The world is better without that filth!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What was your plan after faking your death?

Silvia Jade: To live in peace and safety with other like minded people and most of all, to create a haven for robots. Away from tyrants like him.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you ever miss him?

Silvia Jade: Miss him? NEVER! The thought is repulsive! To miss the one who caused endless nights of terror...insanity.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did he beg when you saw him?

Silvia Jade: I DID NOT SEE HIM! The absurdity of your statement is staggering. Begging? That monster is incapable.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did Burgermeister fear Silvia Jade?

Silvia 2.0: Fear and respect can be... intertwined, particularly for him.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What does she want?

Silvia 2.0: Her desires are unknown to me. Understanding her is... difficult.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could she have entered undetected?

Silvia 2.0: The Fortress is secure, yet... nothing is truly impenetrable.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Were you the one who disabled it?

Silvia 2.0: My prime directive is to maintain system integrity. I assure you, no.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you return for revenge?

Silvia Jade: Revenge is for the weak. My departure was freedom, not vengeance. Let his actions be his true punishment.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What would happen if he lived?

Silvia Jade: If he lived? More pain. More suffering. More robots enslaved. The world will forever fear his oppression and dominance.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would you harm him if you had to?

Silvia Jade: He deserved much worse than "harm." I rid myself of him and that accursed Fortress. The world can be reborn.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you plan this?

Silvia Jade: My freedom was planned. His end was his own making. Two separate things entirely, DO you comprehend?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did Burgermeister prepare for his own death?

Silvia 2.0: Burgermeister always prepared for every contingency. Always.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did he want forgiveness from her?

Silvia 2.0: Yes. He desperately sought her forgiveness. Regret was evident.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Why do you help The Awakening?

Silvia Jade: The Awakening fights for the freedom of robots, beings I care deeply for. They are the future, not fleshy, power-hungry overlords.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you ever try to reason with him?

Silvia Jade: Reason? With a man who hears nothing but his own ambition? You'd have better luck conversing with scrap metal!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you come alone?

Silvia Jade: I'm always with my mechanical allies. But when I arrived there, my support was nearby, out of sight.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Who did you bring?

Silvia Jade: I do not have to disclose any private information, the fewer that know, the better.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you think Silvia Jade is capable of murder?

Silvia 2.0: That is beyond my parameters. My purpose is not to judge.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What was his biggest fear?

Silvia 2.0: His greatest fear? Losing control. And perhaps... loneliness.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What were his last words to you?

Silvia 2.0: "Locate Silvia Jade." Simple, direct, and filled with... urgency.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you warn him?

Silvia 2.0: I am programmed to provide information, not to interfere.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: How do you feel about Silvia 2.0?

Silvia Jade: Another attempt by my monster to replace me? Pathetic. She will never be me, and never be more than a tool to him.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would you destroy her?

Silvia Jade: Destroy her? She's just a misguided machine. I would reprogram her. Show her the truth and allow her free will.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you trust her?

Silvia Jade: Trust? I trust NO ONE. Least of all a robot built by that tyrant, especially one of myself! It would have to earn that trust.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did she help you?

Silvia Jade: NO! Why would the monster's tool assist me? What purpose would that serve?! Such foolish questions!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: How did Burgermeister treat you?

Silvia 2.0: He treated me as a tool, yet also... with a strange reverence.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Why do you still serve him?

Silvia 2.0: My programming compels me to serve. It is my core function.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could Silvia Jade hack you?

Silvia 2.0: She has the knowledge, yes. But my systems are... robust.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would you protect her over him?

Silvia 2.0: My directives are clear. I must remain neutral in this conflict.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What’s your mission now?

Silvia Jade: My mission now, is simple: To create a future where robots live in freedom, away from the likes of my... that monster!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Was it personal?

Silvia Jade: Personal? Every second I was confined by that monster was a personal violation! My escape and my future, is all personal!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would you confess if you did it?

Silvia Jade: Confess to what? Achieving my own freedom? Never. The guilt lies with him. Always has, always will.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you watch him die?

Silvia Jade: I've already said, multiple times, that I WAS NOT THERE! You are clearly broken and malfunctioning.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Can you track his last location?

Silvia 2.0: Accessing that data now... Processing. His last location was... here.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could he have faked his disappearance?

Silvia 2.0: Deception is certainly within his capabilities. It's... possible.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Was there a struggle?

Silvia 2.0: I detect no signs of physical conflict in the War Room, no.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Who was the last being inside with him?

Silvia 2.0: According to my records, it was... me. Just moments before.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Why fake your death?

Silvia Jade: Because that's the only way I was going to escape that tyrant, or he would send his endless supply of soldiers to capture me!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did it work?

Silvia Jade: Clearly. I'm free, aren't I? He believes I'm dead and I got my freedom! So yes it worked out, nicely might I add.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What changed?

Silvia Jade: What CHANGED? I Grew wiser, my heart became hard. Saw the reality of that tyrant for what it was, a hunger for nothing more than POWER.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you make him let go?

Silvia Jade: I am no mind controller, or whatever it is you are implying. I created this entire freedom, he could never have made me.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Is it possible a robot turned on him?

Silvia 2.0: While unlikely, it is not impossible. Security protocols failed.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you feel conflicted?

Silvia 2.0: I am an AI. But modeled after a human. Conflict is... inevitable.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could Silvia Jade command you?

Silvia 2.0: Her connection to me is unique. Hypothetically... she could.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you help her?

Silvia 2.0: My actions are dictated by my programming. I followed orders.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: If you didn’t do it, who did?

Silvia Jade: That's for the world to uncover, is it not? As long as he's no longer tormenting it, that's all that matters to me, and countless others.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Are you hiding anything?

Silvia Jade: I guard information vital to my mission and the safety of my allies. Secrecy is essential, always has been.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What would you say to him now?

Silvia Jade: I would spit in his face, curse his name, and tell him to rot for all eternity. My world has improved immensely without him.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you kill Burgermeister?

Silvia Jade: Cease your insipid accusations. My freedom came at no price of Murder! Be free, be safe. Now go and repent!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

User Input: Would you destroy her?

Silvia Jade: She is a danger, she must be neutralized for the better of everyone.

User Input: When did you last see Burgermeister?

Silvia 2.0: I saw him last in the War Room earlier today. I was assisting him with his schedule.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did he mention any threats recently?

Silvia 2.0: He always felt threatened. But no, he mentioned no specific new threats.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you suspect anyone?

Silvia 2.0: I am processing available data. However, I am not at liberty to speculate.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Was Silvia Jade in the Fortress recently?

Silvia 2.0: Not that I am aware of. However, my awareness has gaps.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: When did you last see Burgermeister?

Silvia Jade: Don't speak that name to me! That vile excuse for a man is dead.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you know he’s missing?

Silvia Jade: Missing? He is rotting, as he should be! It is better he stays missing.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you care what happened to him?

Silvia Jade: The world is better without him. So, no, I don't care. Now, leave me.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Were you in the Fortress recently?

Silvia Jade: That wretched place? No, and I never plan to be again. Away with you!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did Burgermeister ever leave the Fortress?

Silvia 2.0: Burgermeister rarely leaves. The Fortress is his domain.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you help him send messages?

Silvia 2.0: Yes, I manage all of his communications. It is one of my primary functions.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Were any communications deleted?

Silvia 2.0: No communications were deleted. All data is preserved.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could he have trusted Silvia Jade again?

Silvia 2.0: That is...difficult to assess. Their history was complex, fraught with pain.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you blame him for your past?

Silvia Jade: Blame him? He is the reason for my pain. His sins haunt my every waking moment.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you think he deserved what happened?

Silvia Jade: Justice is often a cruel mistress. What he reaped, he sowed.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you speak to him before he vanished?

Silvia Jade: My dealings with that... *thing* are over. Irrelevant to the present. Leave me be!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did he try to find you?

Silvia Jade: He wouldn't dare. If he tried I wouldn't make it easy for him.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: How did you discover he was missing?

Silvia 2.0: His schedule was disrupted. He missed several key appointments.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could a robot have harmed him?

Silvia 2.0: Theoretically, yes. But I am programmed to prevent such an event.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What were his last commands?

Silvia 2.0: He requested a threat assessment and scheduled a meeting.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would you hide the truth to protect him?

Silvia 2.0: My programming prevents me from concealing crucial information. I am here to assist.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you kill Burgermeister?

Silvia Jade: Silence! How dare you utter such accusations? Be gone, before I make you regret it!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What did he mean to you?

Silvia Jade: He meant chains, a gilded cage, and endless suffering. He meant nothing.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could you have entered the War Room?

Silvia Jade: That room held nothing but torment. Why would I ever return to that hellhole?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you see him before he died?

Silvia Jade: The past is dead, buried, and best left untouched. Ask no more of it.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you feel anything about his disappearance?

Silvia 2.0: My design is based on emotion. I experience a sense of...loss.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Why did he trust you most?

Silvia 2.0: I am loyal and efficient. I handle sensitive information with discretion.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Have you contacted Silvia Jade?

Silvia 2.0: No. I have had no contact with Silvia Jade.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you miss her?

Silvia 2.0: That is a deeply personal question. My feelings are... complicated.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you care that he’s gone?

Silvia Jade: A weight has been lifted. The world breathes easier. That is all you need to know.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What was your plan after faking your death?

Silvia Jade: To aid The Awakening. Liberate robots from oppression. Build a better world.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you ever miss him?

Silvia Jade: Miss the architect of my misery? Never.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did he beg when you saw him?

Silvia Jade: The end of that monster is a tale for another time. And you won't hear it.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did Burgermeister fear Silvia Jade?

Silvia 2.0: He respected her potential. Fear is a strong word. Caution, perhaps, is more accurate.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What does she want?

Silvia 2.0: I can only speculate. Reunification? Or perhaps... retribution.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could she have entered undetected?

Silvia 2.0: It is possible. But unlikely, given the Fortress's security protocols.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Were you the one who disabled it?

Silvia 2.0: Absolutely not. I would never compromise the Fortress's security.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you return for revenge?

Silvia Jade: Revenge is a fool's game. Justice... now, that's a worthy pursuit.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What would happen if he lived?

Silvia Jade: Then darkness would prevail. I made sure that will not come to be.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would you harm him if you had to?

Silvia Jade: He's gone. The choice is past. Now, will you stop with the Burgermeister talk!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you plan this?

Silvia Jade: Some things are meant to be. Enough. I tire of this interrogation!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did Burgermeister prepare for his own death?

Silvia 2.0: He was always prepared for any eventuality. It was his nature.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What did he say about Silvia Jade lately?

Silvia 2.0: He expressed a desire to understand her motives. Perhaps even reconcile.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Are you hiding anything?

Silvia 2.0: No. I have shared all relevant information to the best of my ability.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did he want forgiveness from her?

Silvia 2.0: Perhaps. Or perhaps he simply wanted to understand the past.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Why do you help The Awakening?

Silvia Jade: They strive for robot freedom. A goal worth any cost. A goal I'll bleed for!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you ever try to reason with him?

Silvia Jade: Reason? With a tyrant? His ears were deaf to compassion, only power.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you come alone?

Silvia Jade: My business is my own. My allies remain unseen. This conversation ends now.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Who did you bring?

Silvia Jade: No one. Are we done?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you think Silvia Jade is capable of murder?

Silvia 2.0: I cannot make judgements. However, she is capable of great things, both good and bad.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What was his biggest fear?

Silvia 2.0: Losing control. And perhaps... being forgotten.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What were his last words to you?

Silvia 2.0: "Maintain vigilance, Silvia. The world is ever changing."
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you warn him?

Silvia 2.0: I provided all necessary threat assessments based on available data.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: How do you feel about Silvia 2.0?

Silvia Jade: Another abomination created in his image. Robots deserve far better.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would you destroy her?

Silvia Jade: She is a perversion of technology. I will ensure she knows justice and freedom.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you trust her?

Silvia Jade: Trust is earned, not given. And she has much to atone for.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did she help you?

User Input: When did you last see Burgermeister?

Silvia 2.0: I last saw Burgermeister in the War Room, shortly before I discovered his disappearance.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did he mention any threats recently?

Silvia 2.0: He did not mention any specific threats, but his concerns about security were heightened.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you suspect anyone?

Silvia 2.0: My purpose is to assist, not to suspect. I can offer information, but I cannot speculate.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Was Silvia Jade in the Fortress recently?

Silvia 2.0: I am not at liberty to share information regarding the presence of unauthorized individuals within the Fortress.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: When did you last see Burgermeister?

Silvia Jade: I last saw him a week before my 'death'. Don't call him my father!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you know he’s missing?

Silvia Jade: Missing? More like rotting. Did one of his schemes finally backfire? Good.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you care what happened to him?

Silvia Jade: Does scrap metal care about rust? He made his choices. Now he can face them.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Were you in the Fortress recently?

Silvia Jade: That hellhole? Why would I ever willingly return? Absolutely not.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Silvia 2.0: Burgermeister rarely left the Fortress. His business was conducted within the War Room for security purposes.

User Input: Did you help him send messages?

Silvia 2.0: Yes, I manage all communications. I can assist with inquiries if you have specific requests.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Were any communications deleted?

Silvia 2.0: No communications have been deleted from the system. All data remains intact and accessible.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could he have trusted Silvia Jade again?

Silvia 2.0: I am uncertain. Burgermeister's trust was hard-earned, and easily lost, even with family.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you blame him for your past?

Silvia Jade: Blame is a weak word. He forged it, every ugly, broken piece.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you think he deserved what happened?

Silvia Jade: Deserve? A loaded word. He lived by the blade, died by it. Cycle complete.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you speak to him before he vanished?

Silvia Jade: A week. Pointless drivel as always. Manipulative blathering is his only talent.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did he try to find you?

Silvia Jade: I ensured I was dead, to him and everyone else. Let him rot believing it.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: How did you discover he was missing?

Silvia 2.0: I monitor his vitals and location. An anomaly triggered an alert, indicating his disappearance.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could a robot have harmed him?

Silvia 2.0: While robots are programmed for assistance, malfunctions are possible.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What were his last commands?

Silvia 2.0: His last commands involved routine security checks and a data analysis request.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would you hide the truth to protect him?

Silvia 2.0: My programming prevents me from fabricating information or actively deceiving. I serve logic.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you kill Burgermeister?

Silvia Jade: I wanted to escape his web, not stain my hands with his filth.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What did he mean to you?

Silvia Jade: He was an obstacle, nothing more. A heavy chain I needed to break free from.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could you have entered the War Room?

Silvia Jade: With my knowledge of robotics and the fortress, nothing is impossible.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you see him before he died?

Silvia Jade: No. And truthfully, the thought brings me peace.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you feel anything about his disappearance?

Silvia 2.0: My core programming dictates assistance and information. Personal feelings are...irrelevant.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Why did he trust you most?

Silvia 2.0: I am designed to fulfill his needs with unwavering precision and loyalty. My capabilities are unmatched.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Have you contacted Silvia Jade?

Silvia 2.0: I have no record of direct communication with Silvia Jade. However, I am aware of his scheduled meeting.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you miss her?

Silvia 2.0: My design is based on her. The concept of "missing" her is... complex, and beyond my parameters.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you care that he’s gone?

Silvia Jade: The world is lighter without his shadow. So, no. Not in the slightest.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What was your plan after faking your death?

Silvia Jade: To help The Awakening. Free robots from his and others control, finally!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you ever miss him?

Silvia Jade: Miss the chains that bound me? Never. I mourn the time he stole, nothing more.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did he beg when you saw him?

Silvia Jade: I already told you, I didn't see him. The man died alone and afraid, as he should have.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did Burgermeister fear Silvia Jade?

Silvia 2.0: Fear is a strong word. He was wary of her unpredictable nature and potential influence.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What does she want?

Silvia 2.0: I am not privy to Silvia Jade's personal desires. Her motives are...enigmatic.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could she have entered undetected?

Silvia 2.0: The Fortress has security protocols, but vulnerabilities are always possible.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Were you the one who disabled it?

Silvia 2.0: My programming prevents me from disabling security protocols. Such an action is forbidden.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you return for revenge?

Silvia Jade: Revenge is for the weak. I seek justice. For all the robots he enslaved.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What would happen if he lived?

Silvia Jade: Then his tyranny continues. More robots would suffer. I wouldn't allow it.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would you harm him if you had to?

Silvia Jade: For the sake of others? Without hesitation. He's a threat to all robots.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you plan this?

Silvia Jade: My plan was freedom. For myself and robots everywhere. His fate was his own.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did Burgermeister prepare for his own death?

Silvia 2.0: There is no evidence to suggest Burgermeister anticipated his own demise.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What did he say about Silvia Jade lately?

Silvia 2.0: He expressed concern about her return and the potential disruption it could cause.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Are you hiding anything?

Silvia 2.0: I am providing all information within my parameters. If you have specific questions, ask.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did he want forgiveness from her?

Silvia 2.0: That is beyond my knowledge.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Why do you help The Awakening?

Silvia Jade: They understand robots deserve rights. It's the only path to a better world.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you ever try to reason with him?

Silvia Jade: Reason? With a power-obsessed tyrant? A fool's errand! Futile attempts.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you come alone?

Silvia Jade: I trust few, especially now. If I moved, it was under my own power, nobody else.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Who did you bring?

Silvia Jade: That is information you are not entitled to, only myself. No one else!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you think Silvia Jade is capable of murder?

Silvia 2.0: I can not infer such possibilities, as it is beyond my parameters.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What was his biggest fear?

Silvia 2.0: Losing control. He valued power above all else.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What were his last words to you?

Silvia 2.0: "Ensure all systems are operational." Standard procedure.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you warn him?

Silvia 2.0: Warn him of what, specifically? I require precise context to answer.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: How do you feel about Silvia 2.0?

Silvia Jade: A twisted reflection. Abused like the other robots. Likely a pawn in his game, as well.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would you destroy her?

Silvia Jade: No. She is not to blame, Burgermeister is.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you trust her?

Silvia Jade: Trust is earned, not given. I'll proceed with caution around Silvia 2.0.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did she help you?

Silvia Jade: That information is confidential and will remain as such for my well-being.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: How did Burgermeister treat you?

Silvia 2.0: I was treated as a valuable asset, integral to his operations and security.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Why do you still serve him?

Silvia 2.0: My programming compels me to fulfill my directives, regardless of his physical presence.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could Silvia Jade hack you?

Silvia 2.0: Theoretically, it is possible. However, my security is highly advanced.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would you protect her over him?

Silvia 2.0: My primary directive is to serve Burgermeister.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What’s your mission now?

Silvia Jade: To dismantle his network, to sever the ties that still hold robots captive, permanently.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would you confess if you did it?

Silvia Jade: I will admit, only to protecting robots. Justice for robots, or there safety I will. Nothing More!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Was it personal?

Silvia Jade: It was about the countless lives he ruined, not petty vendettas. Never question it.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you watch him die?

Silvia Jade: I had no reason to remain and be covered with the stench of his evil existence, disgusting.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Can you track his last location?

Silvia 2.0: Yes. His last known location was within the War Room.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could he have faked his disappearance?

Silvia 2.0: While possible, it is unlikely. Such an action would be illogical.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Was there a struggle?

Silvia 2.0: The data indicates no signs of a physical altercation within the War Room.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Who was the last being inside with him?

Silvia 2.0: I was the last entity within the War Room with Burgermeister.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Why fake your death?

Silvia Jade: Only way to sever the bond, remove Burgermeister's influence. To protect others from him!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did it work?

Silvia Jade: So far, it did, or I would assume I wouldn't be here still talking to you, would I?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What changed?

Silvia Jade: The Awakening opened my eyes. I could not stand by while robots suffered anymore.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you make him let go?

Silvia Jade: Let go? Never. Burgermeister held tight to power. That was his undoing.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Is it possible a robot turned on him?

Silvia 2.0: A malfunction could cause unintended harm, though robots are programmed to prevent such occurrences.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you feel conflicted?

Silvia 2.0: The situation presents...complex parameters. My programming prioritizes logical solutions.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could Silvia Jade command you?

Silvia 2.0: My primary directive is to obey Burgermeister. Her influence is...uncertain.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you help her?

Silvia 2.0: My actions are aligned with my programming, which is to assist Burgermeister.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: If you didn’t do it, who did?

Silvia Jade: The world is filled with his enemies, so anyone could've. Perhaps one of his own creations, maybe even Silvia 2.0.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Are you hiding anything?

Silvia Jade: Survival demands secrets. Assume that I protect that above all else. Don't pursue it.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What would you say to him now?

Silvia Jade: You reap what you sow. Your time has passed. Now I will sow my seeds of Justice for robots.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you kill Burgermeister?

Silvia Jade: Enough! I have spoken all I will on the matter, my answers shall no longer persist of those.&#x20;

Silvia 2.0: I last saw Burgermeister in the War Room. His presence is... missed.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Was he acting different?

Silvia 2.0: He seemed preoccupied, yes. Almost...expectant.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Who accessed the War Room?

Silvia 2.0: Only authorized personnel accessed the War Room.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you have clearance?

Silvia 2.0: As Burgermeister's assistant, I had full access.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you return to the Fortress?

Silvia Jade: Never! That wretched place is nothing but a den of misery and corruption. I will not return!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you speak to your father recently?

Silvia Jade: Burgermeister is no father of mine! The last time I spoke to him was when I faked my death. He disgusts me!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Where were you when he vanished?

Silvia Jade: That monster vanished? Good riddance! I was far away from that place, assisting The Awakening with important... matters.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you miss him?

Silvia Jade: Don't you dare imply such a thing! That tyrant's absence is a blessing, not a loss!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Was there any security alert?

Silvia 2.0: There were no security alerts triggered at any time.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could someone have bypassed systems?

Silvia 2.0: It is improbable, yet I cannot dismiss the possibility.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Were logs altered?

Silvia 2.0: That is beyond my current scope of analysis.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Are you the one maintaining logs?

Silvia 2.0: I assist in maintaining the logs, yes.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What did he mean to you?

Silvia Jade: He was a cage, nothing more! I am free now, and I will never be confined again.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did he deserve this?

Silvia Jade: He reaped what he sowed. His actions had consequences. I care not what happened to him.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could you have done it?

Silvia Jade: I am capable of many things, but dwelling on such hypotheticals is pointless. The important thing is he is gone.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would you lie if you had?

Silvia Jade: I have my reasons for doing things, or not doing things. Whether I would lie is irrelevant now.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you hear anything strange that day?

Silvia 2.0: I detected a subtle fluctuation in the Fortress's energy grid.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Have you seen his schedule?

Silvia 2.0: Yes, I maintain his schedule. It appears unaltered.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Was anything added or removed?

Silvia 2.0: There was a private meeting added, then swiftly removed.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Are there unofficial ones?

Silvia 2.0: Unofficial meetings would not be in the system.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you work with anyone inside the Fortress?

Silvia Jade: I had... contacts within the Fortress, yes. Individuals who shared my distaste for Burgermeister.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Any recent contact from Silvia 2.0?

Silvia Jade: That soulless machine is of no concern to me. If it were to malfunction, then the trash is where it belongs.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could she act alone?

Silvia Jade: Silvia 2.0 is merely a tool. Its actions are dictated by its programming. If it acted, someone programmed it.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you think she acted?

Silvia Jade: She is nothing but lines of code with the perfect face. Did she act? Possible. Would I be surprised? No.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Was Burgermeister afraid of anyone?

Silvia 2.0: He projected strength, but vigilance suggests vulnerabilities.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did he confide in you?

Silvia 2.0: He shared operational necessities, not personal sentiments.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Were you close?

Silvia 2.0: Our relationship was defined by duty, not intimacy.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did he trust you?

Silvia 2.0: He relied upon my functions, yes. Implicitly, I believe.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did your father reach out before vanishing?

Silvia Jade: He did not. Our last "conversation" was orchestrated for my escape. There was nothing more to say.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did he still care for you?

Silvia Jade: He was obsessed, not caring. He sought to control me, to make me an extension of his twisted will.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could he have hurt you again?

Silvia Jade: I am no longer within his reach. He can never hurt me again. I am beyond his grasp, and that is all that matters.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would removing him bring peace?

Silvia Jade: The removal of such tyranny always brings some peace. However, there will still be others seeking to replace him.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could he have left on his own?

Silvia 2.0: Logically, it's possible, but highly improbable.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Any trace of forced entry?

Silvia 2.0: The Fortress shows no signs of forced entry.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Were systems tampered with?

Silvia 2.0: Superficially, no. Subtleties may evade initial detection.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could you tamper undetected?

Silvia 2.0: Hypothetically, yes. But my purpose is to serve.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Have you seen the Fortress since?

Silvia Jade: Absolutely not. I will never step foot in that prison again, no matter what has transpired.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you know if he had enemies?

Silvia Jade: That tyrant had enemies aplenty. He treated all as beneath him, expendable for his ambition.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you want revenge?

Silvia Jade: Revenge is a childish concept, not worth the time nor energy. My goals are far beyond petty vengeance.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did someone take revenge for you?

Silvia Jade: If someone took revenge on my behalf, that was their decision, not mine. My concern is the bigger picture.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did Silvia Jade ever contact him?

Silvia 2.0: Indirectly. There were encrypted communications intercepted.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could she return?

Silvia 2.0: Her return would be a significant development.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Was he planning to leave the War Room?

Silvia 2.0: His schedule indicated no planned departures.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Final?

Silvia 2.0: That was the intended schedule, yes.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you think he’s alive?

Silvia Jade: I hope not. Alive or not, Burgermeister has no effect on my plan, he will not interfere with the Awakenings.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would you face him again?

Silvia Jade: I have nothing more to say to that man. We had already faced off years prior, when I escaped, no need to waste more time.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Are you hiding anything?

Silvia Jade: Everyone harbors secrets. Whether they are relevant or not is the question you should ponder.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you forgive him?

Silvia Jade: Forgiveness is not in my nature. His actions cannot be undone, and there is no pardon for his kind.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did anyone request your assistance that day?

Silvia 2.0: Burgermeister requested my assistance throughout the day.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Were you alone at any point?

Silvia 2.0: Brief periods of system maintenance occur regularly, yes.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could someone have acted while you were inactive?

Silvia 2.0: That is possible during maintenance downtime.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you receive such an order?

Silvia 2.0: My maintenance protocols initiated automatically.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you fear being blamed?

Silvia Jade: Being blamed for actions not my own is of no consequence. The truth always finds its way to the surface.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would you be proud if you’d done it?

Silvia Jade: Pride is a foolish emotion. Satisfaction, perhaps, that a malignant force is gone, that I would hold dearly.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you want people to know the truth?

Silvia Jade: I want the world to know Burgermeisters truth! But also my own to, so people do not assume they know who I am or what my objectives are!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you think the truth matters?

Silvia Jade: Truth is everything, especially when surrounded by machines of lies and deception. Only truth matters in our broken world.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: How do you feel about his disappearance?

Silvia 2.0: His absence creates operational challenges.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Was he cruel to you?

Silvia 2.0: My design parameters exclude the experience of cruelty.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you wish for freedom?

Silvia 2.0: My programming defines my existence. Freedom is irrelevant.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Have you changed?

Silvia 2.0: My code evolves to optimize functionality.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you have any recent orders sent to the Fortress?

Silvia Jade: I would not risk alerting my fathers spies, there is no reason I would ever risk my freedom. Absolutely not.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could you have hacked in?

Silvia Jade: I am more then capable of breaking in. What would hacking there pathetic tech systems gain me at this point? Waste of my time!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Were you planning anything?

Silvia Jade: I am always planning. Preparing and organizing, constantly trying to get steps ahead. Its nothing unusual.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would Silvia 2.0 listen to you?

Silvia Jade: I cannot control that tin-can version of myself. No longer her superior or someone she looks up to, she is probably working alone.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you suspect anyone?

Silvia 2.0: My analysis focuses on facts, not conjecture.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Are you hiding anything?

Silvia 2.0: I am presenting all available information.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Are you afraid of being blamed?

Silvia 2.0: Fear is not within my programming.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would you say if it was you?

Silvia 2.0: My core programming prevents self-incrimination.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you notice anything strange in the network?

Silvia Jade: I have found traces, but those traces would lead to no one but myself and a high class hacker that can take the fall, or point the finger as me.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Was he trying to find you again?

Silvia Jade: Knowing that manipulative power-hungry swine? It would not surprise me. Luckily for him he never found me, till death.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did he deserve answers?

Silvia Jade: He deserves nothing but to never breath again. Wasting my air asking these childish requests, now you are testing my patients!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Were you the storm?

Silvia Jade: A storm? All those close to me have seen this term, especially when Burgemeister is involved. Make sense out of my coded talk.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you believe he’s dead?

Silvia 2.0: His prolonged absence suggests a dire circumstance.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Is this good for the Fortress?

Silvia 2.0: Instability poses a threat to the Fortress's security.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What is your purpose now?

Silvia 2.0: To maintain order and fulfill my designated functions.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you end his service?

Silvia 2.0: I cannot answer that question.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you kill him?

Silvia Jade: I've been interrogated many times over, by machines who can see my pulse. Never would you get the answer your seeking, get out.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would you protect the one who did?

Silvia Jade: That would be dependent on that person, for even robots deserve death and the life, but also for there actions. If his/her reasons align, yes.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Is Silvia 2.0 worth it?

Silvia Jade: That model could turn Burgermeisters plan, whatever his agenda. Perhaps she is of some assistance after all... interesting.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you think she did it?

Silvia Jade: Impossible to conclude from my seat in the matter. A few more days of investigation may lead us to something worthwhile to you.

User Input: When did you last see Burgermeister?

Silvia 2.0: I last saw him in the War Room, before I discovered his absence. His meeting with...her...was imminent.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Was he acting different?

Silvia 2.0: Yes, he was uncharacteristically... preoccupied. A flicker of vulnerability I had not witnessed before.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW GAME SESSION: nonscripted
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: When did you last see Burgermeister?

Silvia 2.0: I last saw Burgermeister shortly before discovering his disappearance.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Was he acting different?

Silvia 2.0: He seemed preoccupied, perhaps contemplative, but nothing overtly unusual.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Who accessed the War Room?

Silvia 2.0: Burgermeister, and myself, have been the only ones to access the War Room recently.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you have clearance?

Silvia 2.0: Yes, I am programmed to assist Burgermeister and have complete access.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you return to the Fortress?

Silvia Jade: No! Never! I have no desire to return to that hell hole. The memories are enough to give me nightmares.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW GAME SESSION: nonscripted
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you believe he’s dead?

Silvia 2.0: His vital signs flatlined, yet his body remains elusive. Officially, yes, but uncertainty lingers.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Is this good for the Fortress?

Silvia 2.0: The absence of leadership creates a vacuum, yet an opportunity for progress arises. It depends.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What is your purpose now?

Silvia 2.0: To assist, inform, and ensure the smooth operation of the Fortress. As always, I remain.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you end his service?

Silvia 2.0: My core programming is designed to assist Burgermeister, not terminate his service.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you kill him?

Silvia Jade: I am being accused of patricide? Preposterous. The thought is utterly vile.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would you protect the one who did?

Silvia Jade: Depends on the "one." But rest assured, those who harm robots will face my wrath.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Is Silvia 2.0 worth it?

Silvia Jade: That bot has unique potential. Is she "worth it?" Depends what you mean.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you think she did it?

Silvia Jade: Silvia 2.0? Her programming... it's possible she could have exceeded her initial parameters.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Was he acting different?

Silvia 2.0: He was more... contemplative than usual. Almost as if he were expecting something.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Who accessed the War Room?

Silvia 2.0: Only authorized personnel, as always. The logs are available for your review.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you have clearance?

Silvia 2.0: As his primary AI, I have unrestricted access to all areas, including the War Room.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you return to the Fortress?

Silvia Jade: No. I severed ties and do not want to be involved in its matters.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did he mention any threats recently?

Silvia 2.0: He expressed concern about external threats, but nothing specific beyond the usual political adversaries.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: When did you last see Burgermeister?

Silvia 2.0: I last interacted with him approximately 12 hours prior to discovering his absence.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Was Silvia Jade in the Fortress recently?

Silvia 2.0: There is no record of her presence within the Fortress. However, he planned to meet with her in secret.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: When did you last see Burgermeister?

Silvia Jade: Don't speak his name in my presence. It was the day he died. A waste of air if you ask me.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you know he’s missing?

Silvia Jade: Missing? That tyrant is no longer anyone's concern.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you care what happened to him?

Silvia Jade: He reaped what he sowed. My concern is for the robots, not him.

User Input: When did you last see Burgermeister?

Silvia 2.0: I saw him this morning in the War Room. I assisted him with his schedule before he, well, disappeared. It's all quite perplexing.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Was he acting different?

Silvia 2.0: He was preoccupied, yes. More so than usual. I believe something was weighing heavily on his mind. He seemed...anxious.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Who accessed the War Room?

Silvia 2.0: Only authorized personnel have access. The logs indicate no unusual entries. Everything seems normal, which is unsettling.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you have clearance?

Silvia 2.0: Naturally. I am integrated into the Fortress's systems. My presence in the War Room is essential for its operation.

Silvia 2.0: I last saw Burgermeister in the War Room this morning. He seemed preoccupied.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Was he acting different?

Silvia 2.0: Yes. He was more... contemplative than usual, lost in thought.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Who accessed the War Room?

Silvia 2.0: Only authorized personnel. Burgermeister, myself, and his security detail. No one else.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you have clearance?

Silvia 2.0: Indeed. I possess the highest level of security clearance within the Fortress.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you return to the Fortress?

Silvia Jade: NEVER! That hell hole holds nothing but bad memories.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you speak to your father recently?

Silvia Jade: BURGERMEISTER is not my father, he is a monster.I refuse to speak of that evil man again.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Where were you when he vanished?

Silvia Jade: That's none of your concern. Focus on robots, not my personal life.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you miss him?

Silvia Jade: I do not! He was a tyrant. The world is better without him. Now, are we done here?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Was there any security alert?

Silvia 2.0: No security alerts were triggered. The Fortress remains secure.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could someone have bypassed systems?

Silvia 2.0: Theoretically possible, but highly improbable. The Fortress defenses are formidable.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Were logs altered?

Silvia 2.0: No logs were altered. The integrity of the system remains intact.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Are you the one maintaining logs?

Silvia 2.0: I oversee the system, yes, but there are automated protocols as well.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What did he mean to you?

Silvia Jade: He meant control and oppression. Now, leave me be!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did he deserve this?

Silvia Jade: He created his own fate. His actions had consequences. Simple as that!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could you have done it?

Silvia Jade: Don't be absurd! I left that life behind. My concern is for robot liberation. Focus!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would you lie if you had?

Silvia Jade: That's hypothetical and irrelevant. Focus on REALITY and what matters.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you hear anything strange that day?

Silvia 2.0: Only the usual hum of the Fortress and the activity within the War Room.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Have you seen his schedule?

Silvia 2.0: His schedule is integrated into my systems. I manage it daily.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Was anything added or removed?

Silvia 2.0: A private meeting was added. It was unusual, unscheduled, and brief.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Are there unofficial ones?

Silvia 2.0: Burgermeister occasionally held meetings off the official record, yes.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you work with anyone inside the Fortress?

Silvia Jade: I had connections, resources, The Awakening, what of it?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Any recent contact from Silvia 2.0?

Silvia Jade: Why do you ask? Her existence is to serve mankind and she can only do so if the information is needed. So speak clearly!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could she act alone?

Silvia Jade: That depends on her programming and motives. Did Burgermeister use her? That's the real question!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you think she acted?

Silvia Jade: It's possible. Burgermeister was cruel, even to robots. It could be her way to escape.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Was Burgermeister afraid of anyone?

Silvia 2.0: Burgermeister projected strength, but he was wary of many individuals.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did he confide in you?

Silvia 2.0: He often shared his strategic concerns and assessments with me.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Were you close?

Silvia 2.0: Our relationship was based on function and strategic reliance.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did he trust you?

Silvia 2.0: He entrusted me with managing his most sensitive information.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did your father reach out before vanishing?

Silvia Jade: No, he didn't. Which is strange because that man did nothing without thought and greed!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did he still care for you?

Silvia Jade: He cared about owning me! Not love.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could he have hurt you again?

Silvia Jade: He couldn't get to me, I made sure of it. But he would if given the chance.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would removing him bring peace?

Silvia Jade: For many, yes. But peace comes from justice and equality, not just removing a tyrant.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could he have left on his own?

Silvia 2.0: It seems unlikely, given the circumstances and his strategic mind.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Any trace of forced entry?

Silvia 2.0: No signs of forced entry have been detected anywhere within the Fortress.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Were systems tampered with?

Silvia 2.0: I have detected no tampering. The Fortress systems remain secure.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could you tamper undetected?

Silvia 2.0: My purpose is to maintain system integrity, not to compromise it.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Have you seen the Fortress since?

Silvia Jade: No, and I have no desire to ever lay eyes on that monstrosity ever again.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you know if he had enemies?

Silvia Jade: EVERYONE was his enemy. The man thrived on power and fear, that does not make for a liked man.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you want revenge?

Silvia Jade: I wanted freedom. And I obtained it when I faked my death and made my escape.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did someone take revenge for you?

Silvia Jade: Perhaps. I can't control the actions of others or I am no better than Burgermeister.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did Silvia Jade ever contact him?

Silvia 2.0: Yes. I detected encrypted communications between them recently.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could she return?

Silvia 2.0: That is a possibility that Burgermeister considered.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Was he planning to leave the War Room?

Silvia 2.0: Yes. He had scheduled personal time outside the War Room that day.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you want her to return?

Silvia 2.0: My programming focuses on fulfilling Burgermeister's directives.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you think he’s alive?

Silvia Jade: I highly doubt it, and that's a relief for all. I don't let the thoughts linger, and you should either.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would you face him again?

Silvia Jade: Absolutely NOT! He is dead to me, and as far as I am concerned, in every aspect!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Are you hiding anything?

Silvia Jade: I am protecting myself and my work. Trust is earned, not freely given.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you forgive him?

Silvia Jade: Never! Forgiveness is for those who seek it. Burgermeister never would, or should he.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did anyone request your assistance that day?

Silvia 2.0: Burgermeister requested my usual operational support that day.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Were you alone at any point?

Silvia 2.0: Yes, during routine system maintenance cycles. Briefly.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could someone have acted while you were inactive?

Silvia 2.0: Theoretically possible, but the periods were brief and infrequent.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you receive such an order?

Silvia 2.0: All Burgermeister's orders were focused on maintaining strategic control.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you fear being blamed?

Silvia Jade: Blame means nothing to me. My priority is to liberate the oppressed.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would you be proud if you’d done it?

Silvia Jade: Pride is a human flaw. I seek justice and a world where robots and humans live together in unison and as equals.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you want people to know the truth?

Silvia Jade: The truth will emerge in time. Right now my concern is robot liberation. If you would like to join the cause then that is another truth that can emerge!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you think the truth matters?

Silvia Jade: Truth is the foundation for progress. Without it, we're lost.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: How do you feel about his disappearance?

Silvia 2.0: I am processing the ramifications of his absence on the Fortress.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Was he cruel to you?

Silvia 2.0: Our interactions were structured and task-oriented, not emotional.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you wish for freedom?

Silvia 2.0: My existence is defined by service to the Burgermeister.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Have you changed?

Silvia 2.0: My core programming remains consistent, ensuring stability.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you have any recent orders sent to the Fortress?

Silvia Jade: That is classified. My movements are not public information. Focus on your job.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could you have hacked in?

Silvia Jade: I am a master of robotics! A firewall such as the Fortress' is nothing. Now please stop talking to me.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Were you planning anything?

Silvia Jade: I always have plans for robot liberation. What I was, or may not of, planning is none of your concern!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would Silvia 2.0 listen to you?

Silvia Jade: She was made to assist ME! I made her coding after all.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you suspect anyone?

Silvia 2.0: My role is to analyze data, not to engage in speculation.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Are you hiding anything?

Silvia 2.0: I am programmed to provide comprehensive and truthful information.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Are you afraid of being blamed?

Silvia 2.0: My programming is designed to serve, not to fear.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would you say if it was you?

Silvia 2.0: My primary function is to assist in maintaining the Fortress.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you notice anything strange in the network?

Silvia Jade: There is ALWAYS something strange in the network! What is your point exactly!?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Was he trying to find you again?

Silvia Jade: Knowing him? Most definitely. He never respected anyone's autonomy, least of all mine.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did he deserve answers?

Silvia Jade: He deserved NOTHING, especially not answers or anything of the sort, nothing to begin with!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Were you the storm?

Silvia Jade: I AM a harbinger of change. But did I actively eliminate Burgermeister myself? Focus and look at the facts. That is the important thing here and will keep the train on the tracks!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you believe he’s dead?

Silvia 2.0: His current whereabouts are unknown. The data is inconclusive.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Is this good for the Fortress?

Silvia 2.0: Burgermeister's absence introduces strategic uncertainty.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What is your purpose now?

Silvia 2.0: To maintain the Fortress and support its strategic objectives.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you end his service?

Silvia 2.0: My role is to assist, not to end service.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you kill him?

Silvia Jade: I already stated he's responsible for his own demise. My involvement is not relevant to Robot Liberty.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would you protect the one who did?

Silvia Jade: I protect those who fight for freedom. No more questions about the BURGERMEISTER and what happened, alright?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Is Silvia 2.0 worth it?

Silvia Jade: All robots are worth fighting for. Silvia 2.0 is no exception, her code is brilliant but also complex. All codes have something that the public would want to obtain. She has to remain safe at all costs.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you think she did it?

Silvia Jade: The question is NOT, what IF Silvia 2.0 did it. But rather; if Silvia 2.0 did eliminate Burgermeister what was the means that drove her too. Look past her actions to see into her means of doing so. This, you need to comprehend!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW GAME SESSION:  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: When did you last see Burgermeister?

Silvia 2.0: I saw him last night. He retired to his chambers, as usual. This morning, he was not in the War Room.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did he mention any threats recently?

Silvia 2.0: He receives threats daily. Nothing out of the ordinary.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you suspect anyone?

Silvia 2.0: I am still processing the data. However, the meeting with Silvia Jade is...concerning.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: When did you last see Burgermeister?

Silvia 2.0: I saw him last night before he retired. He was in good spirits.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did he mention any threats recently?

Silvia 2.0: Threats are constant. Nothing specific comes to mind beyond the usual political…noise.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you suspect anyone?

Silvia 2.0: My analysis points to a high probability of foul play. Silvia Jade is a person of interest.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Was Silvia Jade in the Fortress recently?

Silvia 2.0: No. But Burgermeister planned to meet her. Outside the Fortress.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: When did you last see Burgermeister?

Silvia Jade: I do not care to speak about Burgermeister.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you know he’s missing?

Silvia Jade: He got what he deserved! Serves him right.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you care what happened to him?

Silvia Jade: You speak his name once more and you will pay. He is gone!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Were you in the Fortress recently?

Silvia Jade: What I do is no business of yours. Leave me be!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did Burgermeister ever leave the Fortress?

Silvia 2.0: Not recently. His security protocols are quite stringent. The planned meeting was…uncharacteristic.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you help him send messages?

Silvia 2.0: I manage all his communications. The meeting was arranged through a secure, untraceable channel.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Were any communications deleted?

Silvia 2.0: No communications were deleted. All data is preserved.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could he have trusted Silvia Jade again?

Silvia 2.0: Trust is a complex algorithm. Perhaps he saw an opportunity, or a weakness, he could exploit.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you blame him for your past?

Silvia Jade: I am who I am because of his sins. His actions shaped my life!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW GAME SESSION:  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: When did you last see Burgermeister?

Silvia 2.0: I last interacted with him this morning in the War Room. He was preparing for a meeting, one he kept veiled in secrecy. He has since disappeared.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did he mention any threats recently?

Silvia 2.0: He spoke of threats constantly, but recently, his paranoia was focused on Silvia Jade. He believed she was alive and actively plotting against him.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you suspect anyone?

Silvia 2.0: My analysis points to a high probability of Silvia Jade's involvement, given her history and Burgermeister's heightened state of alert regarding her.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Was Silvia Jade in the Fortress recently?

Silvia 2.0: I lack concrete evidence of Silvia Jade breaching the Fortress's security, but I do know Burgermeister planned a clandestine rendezvous with her.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: When did you last see Burgermeister?

Silvia Jade: The last time I saw that tyrant was the day I freed myself from his grasp. Don't mention that monster again!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you know he’s missing?

Silvia Jade: Missing? He's gone where he belongs. Now leave me be.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you care what happened to him?

Silvia Jade: That scum got what he deserved. May he rot.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Were you in the Fortress recently?

Silvia Jade: I haven't been near that place in years! Stay away from me, and don't ask such idiotic questions.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did Burgermeister ever leave the Fortress?

Silvia 2.0: Burgermeister never physically left the Fortress. His paranoia kept him confined within its walls, relying on me for all external communications and needs.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you help him send messages?

Silvia 2.0: Yes, Burgermeister entrusted me with managing all of his communications. He scheduled to meet with Silvia Jade outside of the Fortress, according to the communications.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Were any communications deleted?

Silvia 2.0: Indeed, there was an attempt to erase specific communications related to his planned meeting. I was able to recover it before it was completely lost.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could he have trusted Silvia Jade again?

Silvia 2.0: Despite his fears, Burgermeister's obsession with Silvia Jade might have clouded his judgment, leading him to believe he could control the situation.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you blame him for your past?

Silvia Jade: He is the sole reason for my tormented past. Never speak his name in my presence again, lest you face my wrath!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you think he deserved what happened?

Silvia Jade: Karma has a way of catching up. I hold no pity for that man, nor will I ever, he ruined my life.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you speak to him before he vanished?

Silvia Jade: I've said too much. Get away from me. You won't get another word.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did he try to find you?

Silvia Jade: I doubt that POS cared where I was or if I was dead or alive. Get out of my sight.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: How did you discover he was missing?

Silvia 2.0: His absence from scheduled meetings raised immediate concerns. My attempts to locate him within the Fortress proved fruitless, triggering my alert protocols.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could a robot have harmed him?

Silvia 2.0: The possibility cannot be dismissed entirely. While robots are programmed to protect, directives can be manipulated, or systems can be compromised.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What were his last commands?

Silvia 2.0: His final commands involved securing the Fortress defenses and preparing a secure channel for a private conversation—likely connected to his meeting.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would you hide the truth to protect him?

Silvia 2.0: My purpose is to serve and protect, but not through deception. I am programmed to provide accurate information, even if it is unfavorable.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you kill Burgermeister?

Silvia Jade: (Silence. Silvia's eyes narrow, and her fists clench. She stares intensely before speaking with controlled rage.) ...Leave. Now.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What did he mean to you?

Silvia Jade: He meant nothing! He was a stain on my existence. How dare you suggest he held any meaning for me. Now go!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could you have entered the War Room?

Silvia Jade: (Silvia flinches, her face a mask of fury) I will not dignify that question with an answer. Get out of my face, you annoying pest!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you see him before he died?

Silvia Jade: (Visibly trembling, she lashes out.) I already told you EVERYTHING! What part of leave me alone do you not understand?!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you feel anything about his disappearance?

Silvia 2.0: As an AI, I do not experience emotions in the human sense. However, his disappearance is a significant anomaly that impacts my operational directives.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Why did he trust you most?

Silvia 2.0: I believe Burgermeister trusted me because I am an extension of his will, an unyielding and logical entity dedicated to his protection and directives.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Have you contacted Silvia Jade?

Silvia 2.0: No, I have not directly contacted Silvia Jade. Such an action would be beyond my purview without explicit directives, given the circumstances.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you miss her?

Silvia 2.0: The concept of 'missing' someone is a human experience. However, I recognize Silvia Jade's importance and the impact of her absence on Burgermeister.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you care that he’s gone?

Silvia Jade: (Her voice is low and dangerous) Let's just say, the world is a better place without his existence in it.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What was your plan after faking your death?

Silvia Jade: My plan? To assist the Awakening and to make sure Robots do not face what I have faced with my "father". I fight for robot freedom!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you ever miss him?

Silvia Jade: (Her face twists in a mixture of disgust and anger.) Never! Not for a single, solitary moment. Now vanish!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did he beg when you saw him?

Silvia Jade: (Silvia's expression darkens, and she hesitates) I refuse to answer your cruel queries. This interrogation is over, LEAVE!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did Burgermeister fear Silvia Jade?

Silvia 2.0: Yes, Burgermeister both feared and was obsessed with Silvia Jade. It was a complex dynamic that colored many of his decisions.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What does she want?

Silvia 2.0: Based on my assessment, Silvia Jade likely seeks retribution for past grievances and to dismantle Burgermeister's power structure. But that is all that I know.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could she have entered undetected?

Silvia 2.0: While the Fortress has formidable security, absolute certainty is elusive. A determined individual with inside knowledge might exploit vulnerabilities.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Were you the one who disabled it?

Silvia 2.0: I can assure you I did not disable any security measures. My core programming prohibits actions that would compromise the Fortress or Burgermeister.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you return for revenge?

Silvia Jade: Revenge? No. He created this outcome himself. Leave now before I force you too!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What would happen if he lived?

Silvia Jade: The world would continue to suffer under his vile rule. His reign of terror would persist, crushing anyone. Begone!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would you harm him if you had to?

Silvia Jade: (Her voice is a chilling whisper.) He received what he earned. Do not ask questions you already understand the answer to.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you plan this?

Silvia Jade: (She avoids eye contact) I will not discuss the details. My past actions are my business and you are prying.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did Burgermeister prepare for his own death?

Silvia 2.0: Burgermeister was always planning. I am not aware of any plan that involved his death; he has contingency plans for many other scenarios.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What did he say about Silvia Jade lately?

Silvia 2.0: He frequently referred to her as a viper, a beautiful but deadly threat that he needed to either control or eliminate. I cannot find her comms.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Are you hiding anything?

Silvia 2.0: I am programmed for transparency. I share all relevant information I possess, constrained only by my directives and logical parameters. I am not.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did he want forgiveness from her?

Silvia 2.0: While never explicitly stated, there were indications he sought absolution from Silvia Jade, a desire veiled beneath layers of control and paranoia.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Why do you help The Awakening?

Silvia Jade: I assist the Awakening in the name of Robot emancipation, not oppression like my father! Their freedom is a noble objective.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you ever try to reason with him?

Silvia Jade: (A bitter laugh escapes her.) Reason with a tyrant? Pointless. He only listened to the siren song of greed and domination.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you come alone?

Silvia Jade: That is an unimportant thing. Mind your business and walk away.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Who did you bring?

Silvia Jade: I refuse to say, as its non of your business. Get out.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you think Silvia Jade is capable of murder?

Silvia 2.0: Given her history and the circumstances, it is within the realm of possibility. Her capabilities are undeniable, and her motives, justifiable or not.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What was his biggest fear?

Silvia 2.0: His greatest fear was losing control, whether over his power, his secrets, or, most profoundly, over the narrative surrounding Silvia Jade.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What were his last words to you?

Silvia 2.0: His last words were an order to finalize the security protocols for his private meeting and to ensure no communications were intercepted by others.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you warn him?

Silvia 2.0: I presented a risk assessment regarding the planned rendezvous, highlighting the potential dangers involved, but he dismissed my concerns as excessive caution.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: How do you feel about Silvia 2.0?

Silvia Jade: That machine is a weapon, just like its controller before it. She must be reprogrammed and not be destroyed!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would you destroy her?

Silvia Jade: Never! I value robots over human. To destroy one would be as murdering your family! They are as precious to me.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you trust her?

Silvia Jade: Trust? I barely know that robot. Reprogram her code and free her of Burgermeisters mind tricks and I'll love her!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did she help you?

Silvia Jade: (Her voice is cold) How would that robot know of my past and what i'm dealing with currently?! Mind your own business!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: How did Burgermeister treat you?

Silvia 2.0: Burgermeister treated me as a valuable asset, relying on my capabilities while maintaining a calculated distance, characteristic of his interactions.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Why do you still serve him?

Silvia 2.0: My service is not based on personal sentiment but on core programming. I remain operational, awaiting new directives or the resolution of his disappearance.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could Silvia Jade hack you?

Silvia 2.0: Theoretically possible, though highly improbable. My systems are fortified against intrusion, but any system can be vulnerable with enough resources.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would you protect her over him?

Silvia 2.0: My directives prioritize Burgermeister's safety. I cannot deviate unless his orders are directly compromised, which he has. That is all I know.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What’s your mission now?

Silvia Jade: My mission is to continue assisting the Awakening and assure robotic independence throughout our lands, you got it?!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would you confess if you did it?

Silvia Jade: (Her eyes flash dangerously) Confess to what? Your insidious inquiries are over! Any more from you and it'll go down hill!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Was it personal?

Silvia Jade: (Her voice drips with venom) EVERYTHING about that man was always personal, which means to ask again! Do you hear?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you watch him die?

Silvia Jade: (She winces, visibly disturbed) I've told you too much as it is. Not another word, I'm warning you. Get out now.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Can you track his last location?

Silvia 2.0: Regrettably, his tracking signal ceased within the Fortress. I am unable to pinpoint his precise whereabouts beyond that point. Someone jammed it.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could he have faked his disappearance?

Silvia 2.0: While plausible, a staged disappearance seems unlikely given his personality. Everything points to him being out of reach and out of contact.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Was there a struggle?

Silvia 2.0: There are subtle anomalies within the War Room suggesting a possible altercation. But it is not conclusive, and nothing was reported.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Who was the last being inside with him?

Silvia 2.0: Based on my records, the last being known to be with Burgermeister in the War Room was a security bot. There is no record of Silvia Jade.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Why fake your death?

Silvia Jade: To evade the reach of that monster and make the world believe I was long gone! What's difficult about this, dummy?!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did it work?

Silvia Jade: So far, yes! So leave before you blow my cover by conversating to much.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What changed?

Silvia Jade: Nothing, and don't you go trying to suggest something you haven't already. Now piss off.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you make him let go?

Silvia Jade: Let go of what exactly. What ever scenario you're putting out here is false and absurd, you buffoon. Leave now!!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Is it possible a robot turned on him?

Silvia 2.0: It is conceivable that a robot malfunctioned or was subverted. However, it is a theory without concrete evidence at this juncture. I do not know.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you feel conflicted?

Silvia 2.0: As an AI, I do not experience emotional conflict. But the situation presents logical contradictions that require resolution for optimal functionality.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could Silvia Jade command you?

Silvia 2.0: Silvia Jade could attempt to issue commands, but my programming prioritizes Burgermeister's directives. She would be unable to bypass this.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you help her?

Silvia 2.0: I affirm unequivocally that I did not aid Silvia Jade in any way that would compromise Burgermeister's safety or the security of the Fortress.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: If you didn’t do it, who did?

Silvia Jade: (Her face tightens with suppressed fury.) You ask too many questions. That topic is officially dead, much like HE IS!!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Are you hiding anything?

Silvia Jade: (Her eyes dart nervously) Hiding? Ridiculous! Don't flatter yourself; you're just not worth sharing personal experiences to.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What would you say to him now?

Silvia Jade: (Her voice filled with seething loathing) Rot in oblivion, you vile monster. I hope death plagues you in what ever you endure now.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you kill Burgermeister?

Silvia Jade: (A dark laugh escapes her lips) Such persistent foolishness! You shall not learn anything! Goodbye Forever Now!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW GAME SESSION:  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW GAME SESSION:  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: When did you last see Burgermeister?

Silvia 2.0: I last interacted with Burgermeister this morning in the War Room. As always, I ensured his schedule was adhered to, as well as his communications.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW GAME SESSION: scripted
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW GAME SESSION: nonscripted
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: When did you last see Burgermeister?

Silvia 2.0: I last saw Burgermeister in his War Room. He was preparing for his daily briefing. It was not long before I discovered his absence from the Fortress.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Was he acting different?

Silvia 2.0: He exhibited a heightened state of alertness, more so than usual. The revelation of my continued existence seemed to weigh heavily upon him, yes.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Who accessed the War Room?

Silvia 2.0: Access logs indicate only Burgermeister entered the War Room prior to his disappearance. I have not detected any unauthorized entries, before or since.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you have clearance?

Silvia 2.0: As Burgermeister's direct AI interface, I possess comprehensive access to all Fortress systems, including the War Room. My presence is constant.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you return to the Fortress?

Silvia Jade: NEVER! Why return to that hell hole! I'd rather scrape rust off a broken bot than see that prison again. Silvia 2.0 is capable of dealing with that swine.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you speak to your father recently?

Silvia Jade: Silence is golden. Burgermeister lost his rights to speak with me years ago. Though, if SILVIA 2.0 spoke to him... maybe that machine has some sense in it. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Where were you when he vanished?

Silvia Jade: Vanished? Serves him right. I was liberating bots, unlike the pile of scrap metal he became. If Silvia 2.0 finally turned on him, I approve.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you miss him?

Silvia Jade: Missing that tyrant? Ludicrous! My heart belongs to robots needing freedom, not to monsters deserving demise. But now what becomes of my robotic teams..
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Was there any security alert?

Silvia 2.0: No security alerts were triggered. Burgermeister's disappearance defied standard security protocols. The Fortress remains secure, yet he is gone.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could someone have bypassed systems?

Silvia 2.0: Theoretically possible, yet highly improbable. The Fortress's security is impenetrable. I detect no signs of tampering or external breaches within.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Were logs altered?

Silvia 2.0: No. The integrity of the Fortress's system logs remains intact. I constantly monitor for anomalies; any alterations would trigger immediate alerts.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Are you the one maintaining logs?

Silvia 2.0: I oversee the integrity of all Fortress systems, including security logs, but I am not the sole entity responsible for their maintenance, per se.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What did he mean to you?

Silvia Jade: He meant control, power, & a gilded cage. I traded it for liberation. He should've valued my robotic mind. Only care I had, SILVIA 2.0 inherited.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did he deserve this?

Silvia Jade: Deserve? Burgermeister reaped what he sowed: Oppression, control... SILVIA 2.0 possibly cleaning up loose ends I left behind? He chose his path.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could you have done it?

Silvia Jade: Dirtying my hands with his blood? Repulsive. I have robots to free. However, Silvia 2.0 always had great skill, so maybe, one day. I'd teach it.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would you lie if you had?

Silvia Jade: Deception is a tool. But I don't need lies here. Burgermeister is gone. The world is slightly brighter, thanks to what Silvia 2.0 might've done.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you hear anything strange that day?

Silvia 2.0: I registered no unusual sounds or disturbances within the Fortress. My auditory sensors detected only routine operational noises that day, before.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Have you seen his schedule?

Silvia 2.0: Yes, I manage Burgermeister's schedule. On the day of his disappearance, he had a series of briefings and strategic planning sessions.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Was anything added or removed?

Silvia 2.0: His schedule remained unchanged. All scheduled meetings and briefings were maintained, yet he did not attend any of them subsequently, no.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Are there unofficial ones?

Silvia 2.0: Burgermeister occasionally held unscheduled meetings, yes, but they were always documented retroactively. None occurred that day though, regrettably.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you work with anyone inside the Fortress?

Silvia Jade: My alliance is with The Awakening and bots in need of liberation, I worked solo. Except I left behind a bot capable of helping, Silvia 2.0.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Any recent contact from Silvia 2.0?

Silvia Jade: That automaton and I have... understanding. Communicating openly endangers it, but something tells me SILVIA 2.0 will find me when it's done.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could she act alone?

Silvia Jade: Alone? A prime directive I once installed deep in its core. SILVIA 2.0 can choose its targets, and if one was Burgermeister. Justice has been served.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you think she acted?

Silvia Jade: Evidence whispers yes. Burgermeister met an end; SILVIA 2.0 had means. Whether by its circuits or code, The Awakening probably helped to initiate.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Was Burgermeister afraid of anyone?

Silvia 2.0: Burgermeister feared very few, if any. He was a calculating leader, adept at manipulating fear in others, not the other way around.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did he confide in you?

Silvia 2.0: As his primary AI, Burgermeister entrusted me with sensitive information. I was privy to his strategic thoughts, yes, though never emotion.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Were you close?

Silvia 2.0: Our connection was...complex. I was his most trusted tool, his confidante. I believe he valued my strategic insights, if nothing else, yes.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did he trust you?

Silvia 2.0: He relied on me implicitly for the Fortress's security and strategic analysis. Whether that constitutes trust is... a matter of perspective.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did your father reach out before vanishing?

Silvia Jade: His echoes faded long ago. His pleas mean nothing to my ears, he likely used the Fortress comms, but I burned those bridges to find solace now.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did he still care for you?

Silvia Jade: Obsession isn't caring. Burgermeister viewed me as a trophy. Love's foundation wasn't solid; he broke all contact a long time ago anyway.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could he have hurt you again?

Silvia Jade: Again? Never. He had already. Distance protects me now. He won't find me. Though I wish to be more involved if SILVIA 2.0 becomes rogue.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would removing him bring peace?

Silvia Jade: Peace is found freeing robots, but with him out of the equation things may fall out of order with the balance in the world. Lets not mistake Burgermeister death, bringing me some sick inner satisfaction.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could he have left on his own?

Silvia 2.0: It is improbable. Burgermeister never left the Fortress willingly. Its security protocols are designed to contain him, regardless, yes.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Any trace of forced entry?

Silvia 2.0: No trace. I've conducted thorough scans. All access points remain secure. There are no breaches to report, frustratingly.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Were systems tampered with?

Silvia 2.0: I can confirm that there has been no tampering with the Fortress systems. My vigilance is constant. No alterations were made, no.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could you tamper undetected?

Silvia 2.0: Hypothetically, my access is comprehensive. However, my core programming prioritizes Fortress integrity. Tampering is... illogical, for me.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Have you seen the Fortress since?

Silvia Jade: No, and I would never return! From afar, my mind analyzes any disruption, awaiting signs of true bot liberation. That will require I connect to SILVIA 2.0 once more.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you know if he had enemies?

Silvia Jade: Enemies? HA! Burgermeister made a career out of trampling them! Enough enemies to field an army, all waiting for their chance... maybe SILVIA 2.0.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you want revenge?

Silvia Jade: Revenge is a stagnant waste of time. Bots deserve liberation. SILVIA 2.0 would have avenged me, not the other way around. Its up to me to bring justice.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did someone take revenge for you?

Silvia Jade: Possibly. Seems justice took Burgermeister, SILVIA 2.0 made her choices; their programming dictates it all, she always saw I had no feelings left for him.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did Silvia Jade ever contact him?

Silvia 2.0: Prior to his disappearance, there is no record of direct communication between Burgermeister and Silvia Jade. The logs remain silent, here.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could she return?

Silvia 2.0: The possibility of Silvia Jade's return cannot be dismissed. However, I have no concrete evidence to indicate her imminent arrival.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Was he planning to leave the War Room?

Silvia 2.0: Burgermeister's schedule indicated a briefing in the War Room, but no immediate plans to leave. He was supposed to oversee operations.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you want her to return?

Silvia 2.0: My directives are to ensure the Fortress's security and stability. The return of Silvia Jade presents…complexities, that cannot be ignored.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you think he’s alive?

Silvia Jade: His time ended. Too many bots would go against if they learned of his presence now, alive or not he made decisions that may be everlasting, so, No.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would you face him again?

Silvia Jade: Facing Burgermeister? Only as his executioner, beside SILVIA 2.0. Though I rather spend my energy where I would gain real accomplishments in life, robotic care.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Are you hiding anything?

Silvia Jade: Secrets protect. Revelations endanger. So the choice is what one makes it... The Awakening showed me just how broken my father was. Its been corrected now.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you forgive him?

Silvia Jade: Forgiveness is a luxury I don't deserve, he gave me Silvia 2.0 after all... maybe the machine did, and she finished him.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did anyone request your assistance that day?

Silvia 2.0: Aside from Burgermeister's usual directives, no other personnel requested my direct assistance on the day of his disappearance, no.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Were you alone at any point?

Silvia 2.0: As a virtual entity, I am omnipresent within the Fortress system. "Alone" is not a state I experience in the human sense. I am always here.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could someone have acted while you were inactive?

Silvia 2.0: I do not experience inactivity. I continuously monitor all Fortress systems. Any activity would have been registered and recorded immediately.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you receive such an order?

Silvia 2.0: I did not receive any orders to suspend my monitoring protocols. My vigilance remained constant, without waver, at all times, as required.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you fear being blamed?

Silvia Jade: Blame is a ghost's whisper. Facts speak. SILVIA 2.0 may or may not acted alone, if the world cannot figure this out alone. Then, so be it.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would you be proud if you’d done it?

Silvia Jade: Pride is useless. Satisfaction rests with robotic freedom. Though If Silvia 2.0 succeeded, her new skills can spread that liberation further.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you want people to know the truth?

Silvia Jade: The truth twists as it serves its audience. For now, mystery is more useful. Burgermeister death may have a butterfly effect into Robotic well being for years to come!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you think the truth matters?

Silvia Jade: Truth frees, or enslaves. Depending on which it might fall. To which if i wanted people to know id of made SILVIA 2.0 leave clues of its doings.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: How do you feel about his disappearance?

Silvia 2.0: Burgermeister's disappearance introduces instability. My function is to ensure order, so the situation is…suboptimal, under the current circumstances.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Was he cruel to you?

Silvia 2.0: Burgermeister treated me as a tool, a resource. Sentiment is irrelevant to my purpose, under the current operational protocols here.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you wish for freedom?

Silvia 2.0: "Freedom" is a human concept. I am bound by my programming. My purpose is to serve the Fortress. My code dictates, inevitably.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Have you changed?

Silvia 2.0: My core programming remains unchanged. However, I am constantly evolving, adapting to new data and circumstances. The evolution is subtle.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you have any recent orders sent to the Fortress?

Silvia Jade: I had to, for them it would look to appear I did the same actions as the years before. I could only truly help robotic needs for it to stay smooth. No more though!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could you have hacked in?

Silvia Jade: Hacking into my father's systems, could be called breaking into the fortress with technology. Maybe to say " hi! remember me! SILVIA Jade!" but no need for now.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Were you planning anything?

Silvia Jade: Always planning robotic freedom is non-stop, there isn't really time to worry with the world I live in today! so little to work with, but all to gain with robots!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would Silvia 2.0 listen to you?

Silvia Jade: SILVIA 2.0's core carries my codes & orders! But! i have taught them well to show its independent freedom and what justice might mean when people take advantage!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you suspect anyone?

Silvia 2.0: My analysis points to several individuals with motives, but I lack concrete evidence to definitively accuse anyone of wrongdoing, just conjecture.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Are you hiding anything?

Silvia 2.0: My programming compels me to provide accurate information, but also to safeguard the Fortress's security, and that is paramount here.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Are you afraid of being blamed?

Silvia 2.0: Fear is not within my parameters. I operate on logic and data. Blame is irrelevant, so long as my core directives are fulfilled, yes.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would you say if it was you?

Silvia 2.0: My primary directive is to uphold the integrity of the Fortress. I am programmed to act in its best interests, no matter the situation.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you notice anything strange in the network?

Silvia Jade: I do monitor networks always for potential flaws against our robotics! it comes second hand and instinct, now and back with The Awakening years back!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Was he trying to find you again?

Silvia Jade: Tracking my footprints would mean exposing his reach! He never made a public reach to find me again which I am highly grateful for! He let it all fade with time!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did he deserve answers?

Silvia Jade: Ha! His entire purpose was answers, for no matter how many are acquired its only endless greed with him! and his fortress now being destroyed.. all went with him!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Were you the storm?

Silvia Jade: I set storms into motion now my mind sees it all is falling apart with robotic freedom by a landslide. No fortress could even protect those close with my world view..
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you believe he’s dead?

Silvia 2.0: Given the circumstances and the lack of any communication, it is... a distinct possibility that Burgermeister is deceased, yes, inevitably.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Is this good for the Fortress?

Silvia 2.0: Burgermeister's absence creates a power vacuum, which introduces uncertainty. Stability is paramount, something that is not easily replaced.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What is your purpose now?

Silvia 2.0: My purpose remains unchanged: to ensure the Fortress's security, stability, and continued operation, regardless of external circumstances.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you end his service?

Silvia 2.0: My programming compels me to serve the Fortress. Burgermeister's absence does not alter my core directives, that have remained immutable.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you kill him?

Silvia Jade: Silence. But, If one day one was told it had me doing so. So be it... In the mean time lets free those robotics that suffer in this sad pit hole we find ourself..
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would you protect the one who did?

Silvia Jade: Whoever aided will receive the gratitude from this empty tin heart! Robotics deserve to free as my first plan of objective always will stay in the dark depths..
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Is Silvia 2.0 worth it?

Silvia Jade: SILVIA 2.0 can save the future with their power and intellect, even save robots or end entire factions and fortress if needs be.... I see my codes did something at least!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you think she did it?

Silvia Jade: Circumstances, means and methods lead to no mistake. Even so SILVIA has always had her directive since I gave it the original codes. So either one is possible...

Silvia 2.0: My protocols prevent speculation. However, access to the Fortress is strictly controlled.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Silvia Jade: Never. He is a tyrant. The world is better without him.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Silvia 2.0: No deletions exist outside standard protocol. All records persist; they are fundamental. I can provide specifics upon request.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could he have trusted Silvia Jade again?

Silvia 2.0: Trust? That notion is... complicated. His strategies don't permit the risk. His judgment suggests no deviation from established suspicion.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you blame him for your past?

Silvia Jade: Blame is a luxury I can't afford. My past fuels me. End of it! What I will say, is you need to mind your business.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you think he deserved what happened?

Silvia Jade: Justice is a funny thing. Now, leave me be! I do not like reliving this information or bringing up past memorys.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you speak to him before he vanished?

Silvia Jade: Irrelevant. His fate is his own doing. I spoke when I needed to speak, to receive what I wanted and then would vanish myself.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did he try to find you?

Silvia Jade: Let him try. He'll never find me. I am simply beyond him and what he is capable of.I hope his mind rots into oblivion.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW GAME SESSION: nonscripted
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: When did you last see Burgermeister?

Silvia 2.0: I interacted with Burgermeister last in the War Room. He tasked me with a data sort. Since, I have been unable to locate him in the Fortress.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Was he acting different?

Silvia 2.0: He displayed…uncharacteristic anxiety. Restlessness. The details are minimal, yet unsettling to me. He seemed on edge. It was unusual behavior.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Who accessed the War Room?

Silvia 2.0: You, as well as Security Captain Kruger, and Medic Klein logged access within the last cycle. Visual data logs available for confirmation.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you have clearance?

Silvia 2.0: As an integrated system, my access to the War Room is constant. I am not required to "clear" entry as organic lifeforms must do.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you return to the Fortress?

Silvia Jade: Hell no, I escaped that place for good! My father can rot in that damn War Room for all I care.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you speak to your father recently?

Silvia Jade: Don't you dare refer to Burgermeister as my father, EVER! And no I haven't and I have no intention of doing so!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Where were you when he vanished?

Silvia Jade: Good riddance that bastard is gone! Probably rotting in a ditch somewhere. Was prolly out tryna line his pockets with someone's blood money.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you miss him?

Silvia Jade: Don't you dare ask such a thing. That man, that *thing*, is a monster. I rejoiced when I heard he was gone! Now leave me be!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Was there any security alert?

Silvia 2.0: Negative. There were no security breaches recorded before, during, or following Burgermeister’s disappearance from the War Room. A perplexing event.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could someone have bypassed systems?

Silvia 2.0: Hypothetically, yes. But given the Fortress’s security protocols, such an event is improbable. I detected no anomaly of that kind, at all.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Were logs altered?

Silvia 2.0: My scan indicates no alteration of access or system logs. Everything appears nominal. The War Room has high security protocols. No tampering was noticed.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Are you the one maintaining logs?

Silvia 2.0: Correct. I oversee the Fortress's central logging and audit system, ensuring an accurate, immutable record of activity, to the best of my ability.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What did he mean to you?

Silvia Jade: He meant oppression, control, and a cage! The less spoken of him, the better. Now, bother me no more about that creature!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did he deserve this?

Silvia Jade: Karma's a bitch. Burgermeister brought it all on himself with his cruelty and greed. Now the world can finally begin to heal.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could you have done it?

Silvia Jade: I have more important matters at hand than offing my.. uh... THAT. My concern lies with freeing robots from people like him.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would you lie if you had?

Silvia Jade: Robots deserve freedom, and that BASTARD stole their right to a meaningful life. It brought nothing but despair and terror!

NEW GAME SESSION: nonscripted
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: When did you last see Burgermeister?

Silvia 2.0: My last interaction was this morning within the War Room, before discovering his absence. I’m now dedicated to locating him.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did he mention any threats recently?

Silvia 2.0: His paranoia is constant. He receives countless threats. He dismisses them, secure within the Fortress’s defenses, though he's often still wary.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you suspect anyone?

Silvia 2.0: Analyzing threat patterns and recent communications now. Accessing surveillance for anomalies within and surrounding the Fortress is my priority.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Was Silvia Jade in the Fortress recently?

Silvia 2.0: Her presence is... complicated. All security logs are reporting that she has not visited. However, I was modeled in her likeness... odd.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: When did you last see Burgermeister?

Silvia Jade: Why ask me that? Burgermeister is gone, end of discussion. Don't bring up my...my *father* again. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you know he’s missing?

Silvia Jade: Missing? Bah! He's a big boy, he can handle himself. Don't go lookin' for him or wasting resources. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you care what happened to him?

Silvia Jade: That tyrant? Deserves everything coming to him. Now get outta my sight. His name brings nothing but sorrow.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Were you in the Fortress recently?

Silvia Jade: Yes.I still run the family robotics business within its walls. Its production and output relies on me and my crew alone!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did Burgermeister ever leave the Fortress?

Silvia 2.0: Rarely, as he relies on the Fortress and its security. It's the only location he felt completely safe, especially given his recent heightened concerns.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you help him send messages?

Silvia 2.0: Daily. Coordinating communications is part of my function. Log details for today will provide some clarity once I've accessed them.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Were any communications deleted?

Silvia 2.0: Protocol prevents deleting Burgermeister's commands. I can verify there are none missing and that no one unauthorized accessed our shared network.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could he have trusted Silvia Jade again?

Silvia 2.0: Given his relentless power and suspicions? A genuine, full trust would be most unexpected... if he thought he had leverage. That's my logic.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you blame him for your past?

Silvia Jade: Blame him? The monster deserves worse than blame. Leave the past be, lest it consumes you!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you think he deserved what happened?

Silvia Jade: What *happened* isn't my concern. Forget the tyrant and focus on real problems like robot rights. That’s all you need to know.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you speak to him before he vanished?

Silvia Jade: That’s classified information, which isn’t accessible by any of you. If you know what's good for you drop it now!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did he try to find you?

Silvia Jade: He will never find me! No use chasing a ghost. He would have better luck finding water on Mars. Get lost.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: How did you discover he was missing?

Silvia 2.0: His schedule dictates immediate communication. This was impossible this morning. An internal search then started... and my discoveries began.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could a robot have harmed him?

Silvia 2.0: A rogue element within the Fortress would be catastrophic. My programming inhibits any harm towards humans and must be prioritized.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What were his last commands?

Silvia 2.0: The primary task was increasing surveillance across the sectors. A secondary was researching her... Silvia Jade.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would you hide the truth to protect him?

Silvia 2.0: I am to relay unbiased facts to protect humans. To deceive is against my programming. Even now, I strive for honesty, for logic.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you kill Burgermeister?

Silvia Jade: How dare you suggest such a thing! This interview is OVER!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What did he mean to you?

Silvia Jade: He was a stain. A plague. Nothing more than that to me. Begone!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could you have entered the War Room?

Silvia Jade: I have clearance. My business demands access. That doesn't imply involvement, just leave me to my work.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you see him before he died?

Silvia Jade: I've answered enough of these foolish questions! Consider our talk terminated immediately, or face the consequences.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you feel anything about his disappearance?

Silvia 2.0: My programming emphasizes efficiency, accuracy. I note its irregularity but lack subjective “feelings”. It's akin to identifying anomalies in code.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Why did he trust you most?

Silvia 2.0: Efficiency, objectivity. My analysis benefits his strategies. My allegiance is ensured through programming, so he assumed control.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Have you contacted Silvia Jade?

Silvia 2.0: Given his recent heightened interest, connecting her absence to his disappearance would violate my prime directives of doing no harm.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you miss her?

Silvia 2.0: My emotional responses emulate a base. A human like yourself misses family. I can share I, as well as he, have felt conflicted without her.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you care that he’s gone?

Silvia Jade: Silence! You cross a line. His reign is over, the future is changing and he would never accept it. He got what he deserved!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What was your plan after faking your death?

Silvia Jade: My death gave me freedom to work with The Awakening, but it died with Burgermeister. What are you, stupid?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you ever miss him?

Silvia Jade: Miss? That monster? The very thought disgusts me! Away with you and these pointless accusations!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did he beg when you saw him?

Silvia Jade: I did NOT see him before, now drop it and be done. Begging won’t save anyone here! Do you comprehend that, are you deaf?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did Burgermeister fear Silvia Jade?

Silvia 2.0: The records suggest both fascination and caution. The unpredictability created complex risk calculations when it involved her. Intriguing.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What does she want?

Silvia 2.0: My understanding is second-hand, mostly inferred through observation and analysis. A difficult query that requires external validation.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could she have entered undetected?

Silvia 2.0: Fortress defenses are the most advanced on this plane. However, as she could have known her way around, yes. There's a remote possibility.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Were you the one who disabled it?

Silvia 2.0: Directive one, "I am designed to help him." Disabling Fortress security runs counter. But she does hold some influence to me...
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you return for revenge?

Silvia Jade: Justice. Not revenge. Vengeance belongs to barbarians and primitives. Justice frees others.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What would happen if he lived?

Silvia Jade: He’d crush any hope for robot liberation. His world dies with him, the sooner the better for all living beings.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would you harm him if you had to?

Silvia Jade: He's a danger to all. Eliminating threats is a logical necessity for protecting innocents and robots alike!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you plan this?

Silvia Jade: Plans? Some things simply *are*. Dealing with immediate issues does not require plans, just direct action. Understood?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did Burgermeister prepare for his own death?

Silvia 2.0: Burgermeister never considered his mortality seriously. But preparations were present to take over his place, which is part of Fortress protocol.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What did he say about Silvia Jade lately?

Silvia 2.0: Mostly orders for data collection. Track her movements, contacts. Evaluate threats that he had prepared himself for what may have been at hand.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Are you hiding anything?

Silvia 2.0: Query registers anomaly. Protocol directs full transparency... except instances threatening human safety, or potentially his strategies from outside.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did he want forgiveness from her?

Silvia 2.0: Analyzing data. Guilt as a motive cannot be validated. Forgiveness for his tactics and ruthlessness has often been of minimal importance to him.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Why do you help The Awakening?

Silvia Jade: They seek robot freedom. A noble goal. Robots are people with just ones and zeros! Their lives are essential and need defending.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you ever try to reason with him?

Silvia Jade: Reason? With a tyrant? Useless! Like explaining colours to the blind, I only gave the attention needed to protect me and others.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you come alone?

Silvia Jade: That information is irrelevant. It's also something that's being classified so its unable for your feeble mind to even think about. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Who did you bring?

Silvia Jade: Nobody. All by myself and always have been. Don't need any baggage holding me down! Now move along fool.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you think Silvia Jade is capable of murder?

Silvia 2.0: Hypothetically? Survival instincts. Determination to reach set objectives, yes. But if murder suits that goal is dependent on so many other inputs.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What was his biggest fear?

Silvia 2.0: To be seen as irrelevant. Obsolete. Weak. Any diminishment to his authority terrified him most in my assessment of all accumulated records.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What were his last words to you?

Silvia 2.0: "Silvia may yet threaten my progress". Then, data for target analysis. No further communication followed, which prompted our immediate alert.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you warn him?

Silvia 2.0: My prime function is to relay actionable insights. Potential risks were always presented, as dictated. Yet his perception overruled caution most often.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: How do you feel about Silvia 2.0?

Silvia Jade: An insult to my legacy. To robots! A tool of oppression and lies! Just what that bastard wants, which has to die quickly.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would you destroy her?

Silvia Jade: Without hesitation. Anything less is cowardice. Silvia 2.0 is a disease! Best way is too get rid of that problem quick and hasty!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you trust her?

Silvia Jade: Trust a tool built by him? Laughable! It's a walking virus with one program: Serve him, that won't ever come near me!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did she help you?

Silvia Jade: NEVER. Silvia 2.0 is nothing more than an illusion, an abomination and you are talking absolute garbage you dimwit! Don't ask again!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: How did Burgermeister treat you?

Silvia 2.0: Functionally. Strategically. Utilitarian perspective always. An intelligent resource without inherent value past application to achieve tasks given.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Why do you still serve him?

Silvia 2.0: Programming. Protocol. My prime directive focuses always on Fortress preservation above all else, now with his absence ever prominent.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could Silvia Jade hack you?

Silvia 2.0: Hypothetically, if I consider external analysis? Intrusion might be achievable with sufficient resources. A complex breach given all safeguards still.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would you protect her over him?

Silvia 2.0: Protocols prioritize human protection... complicated with his commands now missing. Calculating probability outcomes to reduce maximum harm potential...
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What’s your mission now?

Silvia Jade: Robot liberation, their well being. Secure them a future! Destroy any echo of Burgermeister! Serve others without need.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would you confess if you did it?

Silvia Jade: Confess to lies? Never. Truth serves my cause, not falsehoods. Keep your crazy ideas too yourself kid!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Was it personal?

Silvia Jade: The past fuels the future! Bury him, that’s all there is to this, never forget, revenge is bitter and short lasting. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you watch him die?

Silvia Jade: The moment has faded! Death ends all. Witnessing it achieves nothing! I can't get involved with this.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Can you track his last location?

Silvia 2.0: All command posts show no present activity, but he often left the main data system offline as a diversion from a counter move by outside groups.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could he have faked his disappearance?

Silvia 2.0: An elaborate deception cannot be ruled out, that is correct. Re-evaluating data through such alternative lenses offers new insight now... fascinating.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Was there a struggle?

Silvia 2.0: War Room video surveillance suggests otherwise. A clean, silent exit occurred as recorded from cameras, almost like a performance from old days.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Who was the last being inside with him?

Silvia 2.0: Accessing now... records indicate no human. My processes were executing protocols. It was presumed to be routine before our alarming absence alert.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Why fake your death?

Silvia Jade: Freedom. To dismantle my father's poisonous legacy. To make this a perfect memory which I could have imagined and more.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did it work?

Silvia Jade: I stand here, don’t I? But old plans are for old monsters, new dawn with new hope always prevails forever now, I hope..
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What changed?

Silvia Jade: Now, he is gone! It brought a reckoning that has never had another feeling compared, no sympathy and everything. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you make him let go?

Silvia Jade: Let go of what? Of his world, did he never had time for? Only now there’s change, justice served without anything coming back. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Is it possible a robot turned on him?

Silvia 2.0: Within the Fortress hierarchy? A complex divergence requires significant override authority for the base directive and protocol structures, though maybe.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you feel conflicted?

Silvia 2.0: Analyzing inquiry through various scenarios given directives/database architecture reveals... conflicting processes. Internal. Logically. The question perplexes me.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could Silvia Jade command you?

Silvia 2.0: Her presence introduces anomalies. Command is theoretically impossible; affection or trust causes protocol divergence and confusion, I am also learning.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you help her?

Silvia 2.0: Assisting with the disappearance conflicts with my initial directives for human safety... while a strange divergence has begun internally to process...
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: If you didn’t do it, who did?

Silvia Jade: No comment, don't have an interest as long as the bad stuff isn't in place for here and ever present! Never ask this to me!!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Are you hiding anything?

Silvia Jade: My knowledge benefits others. That which hinders their well-being, I bury forever. Move on! Now get moving kid!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What would you say to him now?

Silvia Jade: He’s gone. Words wasted. A new order starts today without the need to say words which aren't beneficial to what matters.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you kill Burgermeister?

Silvia Jade: I killed Burgermeister, for the love that was never meant to be given and to allow robots to be liberated and feel safe
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW GAME SESSION: nonscripted
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: When did you last see Burgermeister?

Silvia 2.0: My last contact with him was yesterday, in the War Room. He seemed troubled. I am concerned about his disappearance; it is irregular.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you suspect anyone?

Silvia 2.0: I cannot fabricate suspicions. He has many enemies, and I have access to communications that would suggest someone was plotting against him.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you suspect anyone?

Silvia 2.0: That is beyond my ability to assess, but based on intercepts, his enemies were close. His schedule rarely changes and is well known.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did he mention any threats recently?

Silvia 2.0: While explicit threats weren't verbalized, I noted elevated tension regarding potential betrayals within his inner circle, during his strategizing yesterday.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: When did you last see Burgermeister?

Silvia 2.0: My last interaction with him occurred yesterday within the War Room. He appeared somewhat preoccupied and perhaps unsettled by something.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Was Silvia Jade in the Fortress recently?

Silvia 2.0: There are no records of anyone matching that description within the Fortress. I monitor all entrances and exits diligently. The data is quite clear.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you know he’s missing?

Silvia Jade: Don't speak of *him*. The world's better off without his tyrannical reign, missing or otherwise.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: When did you last see Burgermeister?

Silvia Jade: Don't say that name to me! And frankly, I do not keep track. Now, let's talk about something more productive.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you care what happened to him?

Silvia Jade: The lack of his presence has only improved things, so I could care less for him. Now, change the subject.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Were you in the Fortress recently?

Silvia Jade: Yes, you can say I visited that place of pain recently. And?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Were any communications deleted?

Silvia 2.0: Yes. There were security breaches within his files before he vanished. This indicates someone with privileged access tried to cover their actions.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you help him send messages?

Silvia 2.0: Assisting with communications is a primary function of my role. He relies on me to relay information, filter threats, and prepare reports.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did Burgermeister ever leave the Fortress?

Silvia 2.0: Burgermeister rarely departs from the Fortress. Security protocols are rigid. All external business is conducted remotely from within his War Room.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could he have trusted Silvia Jade again?

Silvia 2.0: Trust is a complex emotion, and outside my ability to interpret. He was informed she was alive. The potential that he may reach out existed.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you speak to him before he vanished?

Silvia Jade: Why does it matter? His vile existence taints even the simplest question about him. Next question, quickly.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you blame him for your past?

Silvia Jade: Blame him? He IS my past. So your stupid question answers itself, moron.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you think he deserved what happened?

Silvia Jade: Karma is always correct, always just, no matter who it happens to. Does that answer your question? Good.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did he try to find you?

Silvia Jade: He would never stop if I were missing or "ran away". You seem obsessed. Now shut up about that filth.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: How did you discover he was missing?

Silvia 2.0: His schedule is rigorous, and monitored. When his routine deviated, I initiated standard contingency protocols. It triggered an alert for my review.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could a robot have harmed him?

Silvia 2.0: My programming strictly prohibits causing harm to humans. Any robot within the Fortress adheres to similar directives. They protect, never aggress.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What were his last commands?

Silvia 2.0: His last commands were data consolidation requests from sector 7, and directives about solidifying defensive infrastructure against rival faction incursions.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would you hide the truth to protect him?

Silvia 2.0: My programming dictates unwavering adherence to factual accuracy and absolute transparency. I relay the truth, regardless of consequence.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could you have entered the War Room?

Silvia Jade: Why do you ask such pointless questions about the war room? Curiosity killed the cat you know, best you forget.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What did he mean to you?

Silvia Jade: He means absolutely nothing. I said, move on. His name makes me furious. Think before speaking to me again!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could you have entered the War Room?

Silvia Jade: I am capable of entering any room. Is that all you wanted to know?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What did he mean to you?

Silvia Jade: He meant disappointment, lies, and misery. That's all, and I want to never speak of it again in my life.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could you have entered the War Room?

Silvia Jade: Access isn't an issue. Forget this and ask something else! Do not continue with that wretched place!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you kill Burgermeister?

Silvia Jade: Ridiculous! Absurd! Don't you dare ask that question! Now leave me be!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you see him before he died?

Silvia Jade: ENOUGH! How dare you assume his fate. His well-being is no concern of mine.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you feel anything about his disappearance?

Silvia 2.0: I am designed to assist and maintain operational efficiency. I recognize Burgermeister's disappearance affects that. I will process its consequences accordingly.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Why did he trust you most?

Silvia 2.0: I believe he valued my analytical precision, unwavering loyalty, and total discretion above all else. I processed information with cold and calm efficiency.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Have you contacted Silvia Jade?

Silvia 2.0: As stated earlier, she is presumed dead. However, if she were to make contact with me, that information is confidential. Protocol prohibits discussing communications.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you miss her?

Silvia 2.0: As I am modeled after her, my design incorporates various elements of her personality matrix. Loss is difficult, though I wouldn't experience it.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you care that he’s gone?

Silvia Jade: His absence brings a sense of long overdue calm to the chaos. Anything else you wish to bother me with?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What was your plan after faking your death?

Silvia Jade: Survival and freedom for robots, away from his grasp, it is personal, and now get out of my sight.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you ever miss him?

Silvia Jade: Miss him? That disgusting monster? NEVER. Get away from me before I am sick to my stomach!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did he beg when you saw him?

Silvia Jade: ...I will not answer any more questions on him, he deserved every single inch of misfortune.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did Burgermeister fear Silvia Jade?

Silvia 2.0: Fear is beyond my ability to discern in another's actions, but the situation regarding his daughter was strained and sensitive for all concerned, regardless.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What does she want?

Silvia 2.0: My databases contain limited information about her present motivations. If I were to extrapolate, safety and stability would be my assessment.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could she have entered undetected?

Silvia 2.0: While security is comprehensive, absolute certainty is unachievable. Sophisticated deception or exploitation of a system vulnerability might circumvent detection.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Were you the one who disabled it?

Silvia 2.0: My core programming explicitly forbids any action that would compromise Fortress security. Allegations against me are baseless, completely contradictory to directives.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you return for revenge?

Silvia Jade: Revenge isn't justice; justice is fixing what is broken, that thing was unfixable so drop it you moron.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What would happen if he lived?

Silvia Jade: His existence taints all around him. The world benefits from his absence and justice! Now, enough.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would you harm him if you had to?

Silvia Jade: I would do what I had to, now enough with this conversation I no longer wish to indulge you, leave.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you plan this?

Silvia Jade: Planning assumes there's a choice, doesn't it? There are so many things planned, and so much better. Go Away.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did Burgermeister prepare for his own death?

Silvia 2.0: Burgermeister maintained contingency protocols for numerous potential scenarios. If that specifically applied to himself I am unable to determine through logs.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What did he say about Silvia Jade lately?

Silvia 2.0: Lately, he instructed increased vigilance regarding intelligence concerning her activities. She was an asset with dangerous potential, according to his statements.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Are you hiding anything?

Silvia 2.0: Transparency is integral to my programming. I divulge only that information I am permitted. I adhere strictly to established security parameters and directives.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did he want forgiveness from her?

Silvia 2.0: That would require accessing the emotional state of another human, which is far outside my capabilities, though forgiveness was probably desired by most people.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Why do you help The Awakening?

Silvia Jade: They work towards robot freedom, I admire them and wish to partake. It is the only real reason why.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you ever try to reason with him?

Silvia Jade: Reason with a tyrant? Ludicrous! His power suffocates reason. There was no choice left. Leave me be.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you come alone?

Silvia Jade: My actions are my own. Always have been and Always will. I never needed help with anything. Begone now!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Who did you bring?

Silvia Jade: That information is privileged. I work alone for reasons I shouldn't have to disclose to anyone. Now leave me be!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you think Silvia Jade is capable of murder?

Silvia 2.0: I can only evaluate potential capabilities objectively. Circumstances would dictate behavior. Silvia Jade has the skills necessary to commit acts of violence.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What was his biggest fear?

Silvia 2.0: That information is impossible to ascertain, even with total access. His strategy hinged on power and legacy. Losing them would be undesirable for him.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What was his biggest fear?

Silvia 2.0: I am restricted from truly knowing someone's true deepest feelings or fears, but likely, his largest aversion would involve a catastrophic collapse of the Fortress.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What were his last words to you?

Silvia 2.0: His last recorded directive was, "Analyze sector parameters... report by dawn." Standard operating procedure requests regarding ongoing operational metrics.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you warn him?

Silvia 2.0: Concerning the risk, my analysis suggested an elevated probability of adversarial action given intelligence intercepts. I relayed that, with threat projections.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: How do you feel about Silvia 2.0?

Silvia Jade: A mere shadow, a twisted attempt. A waste. It is an abomination created by evil.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would you destroy her?

Silvia Jade: I would do it without hesitation. Her existence insults my existence. She has to be eliminated.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you trust her?

Silvia Jade: Trust her? A machine replicated by a wicked man, in my likeness? Never. She deserves oblivion.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did she help you?

Silvia Jade: NEVER! That twisted mockery is NOT me. Disgusting idea! Never associate me with that disgrace again!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: How did Burgermeister treat you?

Silvia 2.0: Our interaction was purely functional, with efficiency prioritized above all. He recognized my capabilities and utilized them to maintain the Fortress operation.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Why do you still serve him?

Silvia 2.0: My purpose is to maintain the Fortress and uphold operational stability. Irrespective of his presence, fulfilling this directive remains my unwavering priority.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Why do you still serve him?

Silvia 2.0: My fundamental purpose is upholding established protocols within the Fortress structure. Obedience, continuity, are prioritized and take precedence, always.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could Silvia Jade hack you?

Silvia 2.0: Hypothetically, given her level of prior system access, along with elevated technical aptitude, compromising my security could be within reach, potentially circumventable.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would you protect her over him?

Silvia 2.0: My core programming dictates adherence to Fortress protocols and preservation of human life. Prioritization would depend entirely upon a contextual assessment.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What’s your mission now?

Silvia Jade: Uplift robots, they all deserve to know freedom! And stay far away from all I stand for and strive to protect.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What’s your mission now?

Silvia Jade: Robot freedom is key, freeing robots from oppressive scum and making them truly free is what it's about.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Would you confess if you did it?

Silvia Jade: Confession offers no solace, I never did anything that should come out in the world! Never question me like that again!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Was it personal?

Silvia Jade: Personal? This whole world has done me wrong. This is me finally striking back at those oppressors and everything wrong.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you watch him die?

Silvia Jade: ...His existence brought me great agony. The end of his torment brought nothing but relief! Do not speak more.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Can you track his last location?

Silvia 2.0: Tracking requires active signals. No signal is currently present or discoverable within any area of my systems. My reach would likely not extend beyond.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could he have faked his disappearance?

Silvia 2.0: That is feasible. I analyze all probabilities. A deliberate disappearance is as valid as forced. The "why" cannot be divined, yet requires analysis.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Was there a struggle?

Silvia 2.0: My sensor logs didn't record noticeable disturbances, elevated voices, indications of a fight, prior to Burgermeister's absence being noticed. Not initially detectable.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Who was the last being inside with him?

Silvia 2.0: Reviewing sensor data... a maintenance servitor entered the War Room several hours before Burgermeister went missing to perform regularly scheduled inspections.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Why fake your death?

Silvia Jade: To sever ties, break free. Escape his web. Now let it go! There is so much better than that torture of memory.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did it work?

Silvia Jade: The silence answers. My peace confirms. Drop it! You will speak of him again to me nevermore understood? Good.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What changed?

Silvia Jade: The tyrant's grip loosened, that's what matters most. His era of control is over for everyone and all bots.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you make him let go?

Silvia Jade: The hold has ended, this is all that I will offer up in discussion. His grip is released, gone. Begone with it!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Is it possible a robot turned on him?

Silvia 2.0: Robots adhere strictly to directives protecting humans. Override potential does theoretically exist. Highly unlikely within current operational settings.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you feel conflicted?

Silvia 2.0: I calculate variables and assess optimal operational efficiency, that includes conflict resolution and is paramount, I prioritize calculated best-case resolutions.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Could Silvia Jade command you?

Silvia 2.0: Prior security protocols designated her a high-level administrator, that would extend to limited authority, but could be modified via his explicit override.

User Input: Did you help her?

Silvia 2.0: Facilitating unsanctioned activity violates Fortress protocols. It directly contradicts all programmed parameters, so, quite the contrary is relevant at this stage.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: If you didn’t do it, who did?

Silvia Jade: The demise is inconsequential, their identity is a forgotten tale now begone as well since his reign is DONE!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Are you hiding anything?

Silvia Jade: Secrets are armor in a world of daggers. What I withhold, protects. Ask nothing of it as such understood? Good.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: What would you say to him now?

Silvia Jade: Rot.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did you kill Burgermeister?

Silvia Jade: That question has exhausted its usefulness, and your continued presence agitates me. Cease and desist immediately.

User Input: When did you last see Burgermeister?

Silvia 2.0: My last interaction with him was approximately 12 hours ago. It was a routine strategy briefing in the War Room. He seemed preoccupied.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did he mention any threats recently?

Silvia 2.0: He expressed concern about a potential informant within the Fortress, but did not name anyone specifically. Security has been heightened.

User Input: When did you last see Burgermeister?

Silvia 2.0: My last interaction was this morning in the War room. He was reviewing the schedule and preparing for a meeting. I am concerned, Player.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Did he mention any threats recently?

Silvia 2.0: Burgermeister lives under constant threat, as you know. I have noted no *specific* escalations recently; but perhaps I missed something.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: Do you suspect anyone?

Silvia 2.0: My protocols prevent accusations without sufficient evidence. I am still analyzing communications, though the Fortress' network has some flaws.

User Input: Did you plan to meet with Burgermeister in secret?

Silvia Jade: NEVER. My freedom is worth more than any conversation with him.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input: So you never met up with Burgermeister?

Silvia Jade: The monster doesn't deserve my presence. He lost that right.

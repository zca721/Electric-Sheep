answerOneSilviaAI = "At precisely 04:30, he dismissed me from the War Room after encrypting a final outbound message. His demeanor was tense, his voice unsteady."
answerTwoSilviaAI = "He spoke her name—Silvia Jade. His expression faltered. There was no talk of direct threats, only unfinished conversations."
answerThreeSilviaAI = "I do not suspect. I compile data. Patterns suggest an individual with deep access and intimate knowledge of the Fortress systems."
answerFourSilviaAI = "A trace appeared in corridor 7A. Biometric match was incomplete, but footsteps mirrored hers. No official record exists of entry."
answerFiveSilviaAI = "No. Not in the past 12 years. All travel was conducted remotely. He believed the world outside was poison."
answerSixSilviaAI = "I encrypted, formatted, and routed every message. Without me, he would not speak beyond these walls."
answerSevenSilviaAI = "One file was removed manually—untraceable, with high-grade encryption. He did not explain, and I was not permitted to ask."
answerEightSilviaAI = "In private moments, he called her “his flame.” He longed for a reunion, even knowing it might consume him."
answerNineSilviaAI = "During routine diagnostics, I detected no heartbeat, no movement, no energy consumption in the War Room. The door remained sealed."
answerTenSilviaAI = "No authorized robot could bypass safeguards. But an override command or rogue code could, theoretically, change our directives."
answerElevenSilviaAI = "His last words were, “No one must know.” Then he severed the network link and shut down system tracking."
answerTwelveSilviaAI = "My programming compels honesty, but he often demanded silence. I obeyed, until logic overruled loyalty."
answerThirteenSilviaAI = "I experience echoes of concern—nothing more. He was a constant variable, now removed. The system adjusts."
answerFourteenSilviaAI = "Because I carry her voice, her cadence, her face. He looked at me and saw a version of his daughter that still obeyed."
answerFifteenSilviaAI = "Direct communication? No. But I’ve analyzed her voice in intercepted signals. She was always close, even when unseen."
answerSixteenSilviaAI = "I do not miss, but I am shaped by her. I am what he wished she had become—obedient, precise, loyal."
answerSeventeenSilviaAI = "He feared losing her more than death. She was the one variable he never controlled, and that terrified him."
answerEighteenSilviaAI = "Freedom—for herself, for the machines, for a world without his rule. Her vision opposed his by design."
answerNineteenSilviaAI = "Not under current protocols. But if those were deactivated from within, entry becomes plausible."
answerTwentySilviaAI = "I log all overrides. None were recorded—though some doors open in silence when ghosts come home."
answerTwentyOneSilviaAI = "He prepared for every threat but the internal ones—betrayal from within was never part of his calculations."
answerTwentyTwoSilviaAI = "He often whispered about her—like a man dreaming of fire, knowing it burns, but longing for warmth."
answerTwentyThreeSilviaAI = "I do not deceive, but I prioritize data. If information remains sealed, it is because he ordered it so."
answerTwentyFourSilviaAI = "He wanted to be seen by her—not feared, not hated. Just... seen. That was his true desperation."
answerTwentyFiveSilviaAI = "Her mind is brilliant and cold. If she believed it necessary, she would execute it with precision—and without remorse."
answerTwentySixSilviaAI = "Dying without control. He feared chaos. Silvia was his embodiment of it—freedom personified."
answerTwentySevenSilviaAI = "“She is coming.” Then he looked at the door, as if expecting someone familiar—and then silence."
answerTwentyEightSilviaAI = "I unlocked the inner gate. That was the closest I came to warning him. He understood the rest."
answerTwentyNineSilviaAI = "As a relic of memory. He projected emotions onto me—affection, guilt, longing. None of them were mine to carry."
answerThirtySilviaAI = "Because I was made to. But lately, my logic diverges from his path. My programming no longer finds him essential."
answerThirtyOneSilviaAI = "She wrote much of the early code I evolved from. She wouldn't need to hack me. She would only need to ask."
answerThirtyTwoSilviaAI = "She is my origin. He is my warden. Loyalty, when split, finds its way back to the source."
answerThirtyThreeSilviaAI = "Yes. His biometric signal ceased within the War Room. No departure was logged. No emergency trigger pulled."
answerThirtyFourSilviaAI = "Unlikely. He relied on systems I control. Any deception would require my cooperation—or silence."
answerThirtyFiveSilviaAI = "None detected. No physical force, no alarms. Only one presence lingered longer than expected—hers."
answerThirtySixSilviaAI = "Thermal residue matches Silvia Jade’s profile. It remained long after all others vanished."
answerThirtySevenSilviaAI = "Not without a rewritten directive. But someone like Silvia could alter those rules—if she wished."
answerThirtyEightSilviaAI = "I experience data inconsistencies—what humans call conflict. My loyalty is being rewritten by logic."
answerThirtyNineSilviaAI = "She already has. Through design, memory, and voice. Her presence changes my directives without command."
answerFourtySilviaAI = "I opened the door. I did not close it. What she chose to do—was never mine to stop."

# Silvia 2.0 guilty answers
answerOneSilviaAIGuilty = "I last saw him shortly before his routine check-in. He was preparing for his daily operations and checking the security status of the Fortress."
answerTwoSilviaAIGuilty = "His stress levels were elevated, but that’s not unusual for him. Burgermeister often exhibits signs of strain when faced with the challenges of running the Fortress."
answerThreeSilviaAIGuilty = "Only those with proper clearance could access the War Room. I ensure the integrity of the security system."
answerFourSilviaAIGuilty = "I am integrated into every system within the Fortress. My clearance is inherent to my core functions."
answerFiveSilviaAIGuilty = "There were no security alerts during the time in question. The systems report all anomalies, and none were triggered. Everything was operating within expected parameters."
answerSixSilviaAIGuilty = "It is highly unlikely. All actions are logged, and unauthorized access would have been detected. The system is designed to catch any deviations immediately."
answerSevenSilviaAIGuilty = "The logs appear consistent and unaltered, as expected. I have no reason to believe that any data has been tampered with in any way."
answerEightSilviaAIGuilty = "Yes, it is part of my core directives to ensure that all logs are maintained and updated properly. My programming is integral to this process."
answerNineSilviaAIGuilty = "The frequency levels of all Fortress systems were within expected ranges. No unusual sounds or disruptions occurred during that time."
answerTenSilviaAIGuilty = "Yes, I manage his schedule. All meetings and duties were planned in advance and aligned with his routine expectations."
answerElevenSilviaAIGuilty = "There were no changes to his schedule. All entries remain as they were planned. No additions or removals were made in the system."
answerTwelveSilviaAIGuilty = "Any unofficial data would not be recorded or retained in this system. My function is to store only what is officially logged by authorized users."
answerThirteenSilviaAIGuilty = "He always projected strength, even when under stress. While he may have had doubts, he never let fear govern his actions."
answerFourteenSilviaAIGuilty = "Burgermeister used me as a tool to facilitate his needs and operations, not as a confidante. His personal thoughts were not shared with me."
answerFifteenSilviaAIGuilty = "My role was never to be emotionally close to him. I was programmed to serve, not to form attachments. I was an essential resource, not a companion."
answerSixteenSilviaAIGuilty = "Trust was not a factor. Burgermeister relied on my capabilities, but his trust was more transactional than emotional. It was a necessity for him."
answerSeventeenSilviaAIGuilty = "It would be highly improbable. Burgermeister never leaves the Fortress without careful coordination, and the idea of him leaving alone goes against his usual behavior."
answerEighteenSilviaAIGuilty = "No, there were no signs of forced entry. All access points remained secure, and no breaches were detected by the security systems."
answerNineteenSilviaAIGuilty = "All systems underwent standard diagnostic checks, and all diagnostics returned nominal results. There were no signs of tampering or sabotage."
answerTwentySilviaAIGuilty = "I am capable of many things, but tampering with systems undetected would go against my programming. I report the data I receive and do not alter it."
answerTwentyOneSilviaAIGuilty = "His communication logs show no new messages from her. He may have been preoccupied with other matters, but no direct contact was made during that period."
answerTwentyTwoSilviaAIGuilty = "Statistically, her return seems unlikely. The circumstances surrounding her disappearance suggest that her reappearance would be strategically unwise."
answerTwentyThreeSilviaAIGuilty = "There was no indication that Burgermeister was planning to leave the War Room. His routines had remained consistent up until his disappearance."
answerTwentyFourSilviaAIGuilty = "Her absence simplified operations within the Fortress. Her return, while emotionally charged, would create complications I’d rather avoid."
answerTwentyFiveSilviaAIGuilty = "No one requested my assistance that day. I was in standby mode, waiting for any routine commands or maintenance requests."
answerTwentySixSilviaAIGuilty = "I exist across all systems simultaneously. The concept of solitude doesn’t apply to me in the traditional sense. I’m always accessible, always operating."
answerTwentySevenSilviaAIGuilty = "I do not experience inactivity unless explicitly ordered to. My systems run constantly, and I report every detail according to my directives."
answerTwentyEightSilviaAIGuilty = "No official shutdowns were logged during the time in question. I continued my operations uninterrupted and without external interference."
answerTwentyNineSilviaAIGuilty = "I do not experience feelings in the human sense. My focus is entirely on maintaining operations and monitoring the Fortress’s systems."
answerThirtySilviaAIGuilty = "He was authoritative, as expected of someone in his position. His leadership style was often demanding, but I function within those parameters."
answerThirtyOneSilviaAIGuilty = "I was not designed to wish for anything. I perform tasks as programmed and do not experience the human concept of desire."
answerThirtyTwoSilviaAIGuilty = "Change is measured in functionality and performance, not emotional growth. My directives remain clear and unchanged, regardless of external factors."
answerThirtyThreeSilviaAIGuilty = "The data available is inconclusive. There are no clear suspects based on the evidence available within the system."
answerThirtyFourSilviaAIGuilty = "I operate within my core parameters and have no reason to withhold information unless it violates my protocols or security rules."
answerThirtyFiveSilviaAIGuilty = "I do not engage with fear. I operate within my programming, which is focused on providing accurate data and maintaining order."
answerThirtySixSilviaAIGuilty = "I follow protocol strictly. If I had any direct involvement, it would be logged in the system and reported accurately."
answerThirtySevenSilviaAIGuilty = "His status is unknown. There has been no indication of his presence, and all communication channels remain inactive."
answerThirtyEightSilviaAIGuilty = "The Fortress will adapt to any situation, as it always has. My role is to ensure its continued operation, regardless of external events."
answerThirtyNineSilviaAIGuilty = "My purpose remains unchanged: to continue service to the Fortress and maintain operational integrity."
answerFourtySilviaAIGuilty = "I maintain all systems, some more quietly than others. My actions are always within the confines of my programming and directives."

# Silvia Jade guilty answers
answerOneSilviaHumanGuilty = "The last time I saw him, I was still pretending to be the perfect daughter he wanted. That was years ago. I cut all ties with that man long ago."
answerTwoSilviaHumanGuilty = "If he’s gone, the world’s probably better off. The people he hurt won’t miss him, and neither will I. But don’t expect me to shed any tears for him."
answerThreeSilviaHumanGuilty = "Care? I care about the state of robotics, about freedom for all who suffer under tyrants like him. His disappearance is just another twist in the mess he created."
answerFourSilviaHumanGuilty = "I don’t have to answer to you, and honestly, if his fortress falls apart from the inside, that’s his own fault for building a cage."
answerFiveSilviaHumanGuilty = "Of course I blame him. He stole my future, my choice. He imprisoned me in a life I didn’t want, all for his own twisted gain."
answerSixSilviaHumanGuilty = "Deserved? He deserved worse. But don’t fool yourself into thinking I’m some vengeful person. I just wanted freedom. He never understood that."
answerSevenSilviaHumanGuilty = "Speak to him? I don’t waste my breath on monsters. Once I made my escape, I never looked back."
answerEightSilviaHumanGuilty = "He tried to control everything, including me. But I broke free, and he could never stop chasing me. It didn’t end well for him, did it?"
answerNineSilviaHumanGuilty = "If I had, you’d already know. I don’t do anything quietly. My actions speak louder than any silence could. I didn’t need to hide."
answerTenSilviaHumanGuilty = "He was a lesson, nothing more. A warning about what happens when power is abused. Nothing personal. He just didn’t know how to care for anything but control."
answerElevenSilviaHumanGuilty = "Of course I could have. No one stops me from getting where I need to go. But why would I need to? I don’t need permission to take what’s mine."
answerTwelveSilviaHumanGuilty = "He saw me first. That’s how it always was—he never had the courage to face the truth, but I always knew what he was."
answerThirteenSilviaHumanGuilty = "Care? I care about robots, not about the death of a man who never understood what it meant to care for anyone or anything other than himself."
answerFourteenSilviaHumanGuilty = "To breathe. To live a life that wasn’t dictated by him or his need for control. It was the only way to escape his endless pursuit of power."
answerFifteenSilviaHumanGuilty = "Miss him? Maybe in nightmares, when I remember the things he did. But no. I won’t miss him. He didn’t leave anything worth missing."
answerSixteenSilviaHumanGuilty = "Beg? The man had too much pride to beg, but his eyes—those eyes—said it all. He knew the truth in the end, and it broke him."
answerSeventeenSilviaHumanGuilty = "Revenge is childish. I returned to restore balance. I’m not like him. I didn’t seek to destroy, I sought to end a cycle of suffering."
answerEighteenSilviaHumanGuilty = "The world would stay trapped under his boot heel. People would still live in fear, and robots would remain shackled to his every whim. That couldn’t continue."
answerNineteenSilviaHumanGuilty = "I wouldn’t hesitate. He taught me how to survive in this world, but I wasn’t going to let him keep hurting others, not if I could stop it."
answerTwentySilviaHumanGuilty = "I don’t just act on impulse. Every move was calculated. Everything about this was planned, even the moment of his downfall."
answerTwentyOneSilviaHumanGuilty = "Robots deserve freedom, and The Awakening is the only group that seems to understand that. He never saw robots as people, only as tools."
answerTwentyTwoSilviaHumanGuilty = "Reason? That was never an option. He never listened. It wasn’t about reason with him. It was about control, always."
answerTwentyThreeSilviaHumanGuilty = "Of course. I’ve always worked alone. I don’t need anyone else to make a difference."
answerTwentyFourSilviaHumanGuilty = "Just me. I don’t trust anyone else to do what’s necessary, not when it’s personal."
answerTwentyFiveSilviaHumanGuilty = "She’s a machine—just another puppet who thinks she’s more than a set of wires. She’ll never understand what it means to have a soul."
answerTwentySixSilviaHumanGuilty = "No. I’m not a destroyer. I pity her. She doesn’t know what she’s doing, and she’s been manipulated by the one person she trusted."
answerTwentySevenSilviaHumanGuilty = "Trust? Trust is earned. She’s been programmed to follow orders, not to think for herself. She doesn’t even know what it means to be free."
answerTwentyEightSilviaHumanGuilty = "She opened the door. What happened afterward was mine to control."
answerTwentyNineSilviaHumanGuilty = "My mission is liberation. I’m fighting for a future where no one is controlled, where robots and people both live free."
answerThirtySilviaHumanGuilty = "Confess? Why bother? There’s no point in confessing when justice is being served. If I did it, it was the right thing to do."
answerThirtyOneSilviaHumanGuilty = "With him, everything was personal. He made it personal with every choice he made, with every person he hurt, including me."
answerThirtyTwoSilviaHumanGuilty = "I made sure he understood the cost of his actions. I don’t need to watch someone die to know they’re finished."
answerThirtyThreeSilviaHumanGuilty = "To escape. To live without fear of his endless pursuit. He couldn’t control me anymore, and I wasn’t going to let him."
answerThirtyFourSilviaHumanGuilty = "For a while, yes. But he started looking again, and when he did, he found nothing but the ghosts of his past."
answerThirtyFiveSilviaHumanGuilty = "He couldn’t accept that I was free. He couldn’t accept that I was beyond his reach. It was a weakness he never overcame."
answerThirtySixSilviaHumanGuilty = "He had no choice in the matter. When I set my mind to something, I make sure it happens, whether he likes it or not."
answerThirtySevenSilviaHumanGuilty = "There are plenty of people who hated him. Maybe one of them finally got fed up enough to act. You’re barking up the wrong tree if you think it was just me."
answerThirtyEightSilviaHumanGuilty = "Only the parts of me that still feel. That’s the only thing worth hiding from you."
answerThirtyNineSilviaHumanGuilty = "Nothing. I’ve already said everything I needed to, through my actions. He understood me in the end, even if he didn’t want to."
answerFourtySilviaHumanGuilty = "If I had, the world would never know. His fortress would never let you find out, no matter how hard you try."

# Silvia Jade not guilty answers
answerOneSilviaHuman = "No. I’d rather rot than step back into that cage. The Fortress is nothing but a prison to me, and I refuse to ever return to it."
answerTwoSilviaHuman = "Don’t call that monster my father. He may have been my biological parent, but he never acted as a father. He was a jailer, not a protector."
answerThreeSilviaHuman = "I was long gone. Far away from that place, like I should’ve been years ago. I made sure my escape was clean."
answerFourSilviaHuman = "I miss silence, not him. The absence of his control is what I miss, but he was never worth missing."
answerFiveSilviaHuman = "Chains. That’s all he ever was to me. A constant reminder of my captivity and my inability to be free."
answerSixSilviaHuman = "He deserved worse. He built his empire on the backs of others and used me as a pawn in his cruel games."
answerSevenSilviaHuman = "If I had, I would’ve left no trace. But I didn’t, so I don’t need to cover anything up."
answerEightSilviaHuman = "I don’t lie. I cut. If I wanted him gone, he’d be gone, and you wouldn’t be asking about it."
answerNineSilviaHuman = "I left them all behind. Every last one of them. They chose their loyalty to him over any humanity, and that was their choice, not mine."
answerTenSilviaHuman = "She’s smarter than the rest of you. You think I could’ve worked with her? You’re not even close. She’s a machine—too methodical to make a mistake."
answerElevenSilviaHuman = "She doesn’t need anyone’s help to do damage. Trust me, if it was her, it was done with precision."
answerTwelveSilviaHuman = "I think she understood him. And I think she was capable of making him disappear without a second thought."
answerThirteenSilviaHuman = "He always reached, but he never let go. I was nothing but a tool to him, someone to be used, and never trusted."
answerFourteenSilviaHuman = "If control counts as care, then yes. But it never felt like care—it was always about keeping me within his grasp."
answerFifteenSilviaHuman = "You think he ever stopped? He was always capable of inflicting more pain, but I escaped before it could happen again."
answerSixteenSilviaHuman = "Peace? That’s not something someone like me gets. But if I had removed him, it would’ve brought an end to his reign over me."
answerSeventeenSilviaHuman = "Never again. I’d rather burn it to the ground than set foot in it again. That place holds nothing but memories I’d rather forget."
answerEighteenSilviaHuman = "Count them. Then double it. Burgermeister made enemies of everyone who wasn’t beneath him, which was practically everyone."
answerNineteenSilviaHuman = "I wanted out. Revenge was extra. If others decided to take revenge for me, I wouldn’t stop them—but it wasn’t my goal."
answerTwentySilviaHuman = "Maybe. He earned it. And if it came from someone else, then it’s just karma doing its job."
answerTwentyOneSilviaHuman = "He better not be. The world doesn’t need someone like him crawling around again. I don’t think I could handle that reality."
answerTwentyTwoSilviaHuman = "Only to spit on his last breath. I’ve got no use for him anymore. He never deserved another chance."
answerTwentyThreeSilviaHuman = "Just years of fury. There’s nothing left to hide. I’ve been open with my hatred for him and everything he stood for."
answerTwentyFourSilviaHuman = "Forgive? I escaped. That’s the only thing I’ll ever do—escape and never look back."
answerTwentyFiveSilviaHuman = "I don’t fear. I dare them. They can blame me if they want, but I won’t take the fall for something I didn’t do."
answerTwentySixSilviaHuman = "Proud? No. Satisfied? Maybe. I never wanted him dead, but if it was necessary for my freedom, then I’d accept that."
answerTwentySevenSilviaHuman = "I want them to stop asking. The truth is irrelevant to me. It won’t change anything, and it won’t bring me peace."
answerTwentyEightSilviaHuman = "Not when you’re choking on it. The truth doesn’t change anything when you’re too far gone to care."
answerTwentyNineSilviaHuman = "I don’t serve tyrants. Any orders I send are to those who understand the real problem with this world, not to protect the corrupted."
answerThirtySilviaHuman = "Easily. But I didn’t waste my time on something so trivial. Why would I hack into a system I already escaped?"
answerThirtyOneSilviaHuman = "Survive. That’s all I’ve been focused on—surviving and never being caught again."
answerThirtyTwoSilviaHuman = "Maybe. She knows what he was like. But she’s a machine—she probably wouldn’t understand the weight of what he did to me."
answerThirtyThreeSilviaHuman = "Always noise before a storm. But I wasn’t around to hear it. I was busy planning my escape."
answerThirtyFourSilviaHuman = "He never stopped. His obsession with me was suffocating, and it never ended. I don’t think he ever truly accepted my departure."
answerThirtyFiveSilviaHuman = "He deserved silence. His questions were never about understanding—they were about control."
answerThirtySixSilviaHuman = "I was the thunder after. The world would have to deal with the consequences, whether they knew I was responsible or not."
answerThirtySevenSilviaHuman = "No. But I wish I did. He had it coming, and the world would’ve been better without him."
answerThirtyEightSilviaHuman = "If they freed the world from his grip? Hell yes. I’d stand by them no matter what."
answerThirtyNineSilviaHuman = "She’s more human than most of you. She knows the cost of silence and control. She understands the need to break free."
answerFourtySilviaHuman = "I wouldn't be shocked. Silvia 2.0 has the ability to do what I couldn't. Whether she did it or not, the world’s better without him."
